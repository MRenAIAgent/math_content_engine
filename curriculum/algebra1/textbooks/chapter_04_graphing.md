## 4.1 Use the Rectangular Coordinate System

### Learning Objectives
- Plot points on a rectangular coordinate system
- Identify points on a graph
- Verify solutions to equations in two variables
- Complete tables of solutions

### Key Concepts

**Coordinate Plane**
- Horizontal axis: x-axis
- Vertical axis: y-axis
- Origin: point (0, 0) where axes intersect
- Four quadrants: I (++), II (−+), III (−−), IV (+−)

**Ordered Pair**: (x, y) where x is the horizontal coordinate and y is the vertical coordinate.

### Examples

**Example 1:** Plot the points A(−3, 4), B(2, −1), C(0, 3), D(−4, 0)
```
A: 3 left, 4 up → Quadrant II
B: 2 right, 1 down → Quadrant IV

D: on x-axis, 4 left
```

**Example 2:** Complete the table for y = 2x − 3

| x | y = 2x − 3 | (x, y) |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 0 | 2(0) − 3 = −3 | (0, −3) |
| 2 | 2(2) − 3 = 1 | (2, 1) |
| −1 | 2(−1) − 3 = −5 | (−1, −5) |

### Practice Problems

1. Plot and identify the quadrant:
   a) (4, 3)
   b) (−2, 5)
   c) (−3, −4)
   d) (5, −2)

## 4.3 Graph with Intercepts

### Learning Objectives
- Find the x and y intercepts
- Graph a line using intercepts

### Key Concepts

**x-intercept**: Point where the line crosses the x-axis. At this point, y = 0.
Form: (a, 0)

**y-intercept**: Point where the line crosses the y-axis. At this point, x = 0.
Form: (0, b)

### Finding Intercepts

| To find... | Set... | Then solve for... |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| x-intercept | y = 0 | x |
| y-intercept | x = 0 | y |

### Examples

**Example 1:** Find intercepts and graph 3x + 2y = 12

Find x-intercept (set y = 0):
```
3x + 2(0) = 12
3x = 12
x = 4
x-intercept: (4, 0)
```

Find y-intercept (set x = 0):
```
3(0) + 2y = 12
2y = 12
y = 6
y-intercept: (0, 6)
```

**Example 2:** Find intercepts for y = 4x − 8

x-intercept: 0 = 4x − 8 → x = 2 → (2, 0)
y-intercept: y = 4(0) − 8 = −8 → (0, −8)

### Practice Problems

   a) 2x + 5y = 10
   b) x − 3y = 9
   c) 4x + y = 8

2. Graph using intercepts:

## 4.4 Understand Slope of a Line

### Learning Objectives
- Find the slope of a line from its graph
- Find the slope of horizontal and vertical lines
- Use the slope formula
- Graph a line given a point and the slope
- Solve slope applications

### Key Concepts

**Slope Definition**
Slope measures the steepness of a line. It is the ratio of vertical change (rise) to horizontal change (run).

**Slope Formula**
$$m = \frac{rise}{run} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

where (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) are two points on the line.

### Slope Interpretation

| Slope | Direction | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Positive (m > 0) | Line goes up left to right | m = 2/3 |
| Negative (m < 0) | Line goes down left to right | m = −1/2 |
| Zero (m = 0) | Horizontal line | y = 5 |
| Undefined | Vertical line | x = 3 |

### Examples

**Example 1:** Find slope from graph with points (1, 2) and (4, 5)
```
m = (y₂ − y₁)/(x₂ − x₁)
m = (5 − 2)/(4 − 1)
m = 3/3
m = 1
```

**Example 2:** Find slope through (−2, 5) and (3, −5)
```
m = (−5 − 5)/(3 − (−2))
m = −10/5
m = −2
```

**Example 3:** Find slope of y = 4 (horizontal line)
```
Any two points: (0, 4) and (5, 4)
m = (4 − 4)/(5 − 0) = 0/5 = 0
Horizontal lines have slope 0.
```

**Example 4:** Find slope of x = 3 (vertical line)
```
Any two points: (3, 0) and (3, 5)
m = (5 − 0)/(3 − 3) = 5/0 = undefined
Vertical lines have undefined slope.
```

### Graphing with Point and Slope

**Example:** Graph line through (1, −1) with slope m = 3/4
```
1. Plot (1, −1)
2. From that point: rise 3, run 4 → get point (5, 2)
3. Plot (5, 2)
4. Draw line through both points
```

### Real-World Applications

**Road Grade**: A road rises 4 feet over a horizontal distance of 100 feet.
```
Grade = rise/run = 4/100 = 0.04 = 4%
```

**Wheelchair Ramp**: ADA requires max slope of 1:12 (rise:run)
```
m = 1/12 ≈ 0.083
For 2-foot rise: run = 2 × 12 = 24 feet
```

### Practice Problems

1. Find slope using the formula:
   a) (2, 3) and (5, 9)
   b) (−1, 4) and (3, −2)
   c) (0, 5) and (4, 5)

2. Identify slope type:
   a) y = 7
   b) x = −2
   c) y = 3x + 1

3. Graph line given point and slope:
   a) Point (0, 2), m = 3
   b) Point (−1, 3), m = −2
   c) Point (2, 1), m = 1/2

## 4.5 Use the Slope-Intercept Form of an Equation

### Learning Objectives
- Recognize slope-intercept form
- Identify slope and y-intercept from an equation
- Graph using slope-intercept form
- Use slope-intercept form in applications

### Key Concepts

**Slope-Intercept Form**
$$y = mx + b$$

where:
- m = slope
- b = y-intercept (the point (0, b))

### Examples

**Example 1:** Identify slope and y-intercept of y = 3x − 5
```
Comparing to y = mx + b:
m = 3 (slope)
b = −5 (y-intercept is (0, −5))
```

**Example 2:** Rewrite 4x + 2y = 8 in slope-intercept form
```
4x + 2y = 8
2y = −4x + 8
y = −2x + 4

Slope: m = −2
y-intercept: (0, 4)
```

**Example 3:** Graph y = (2/3)x − 1 using slope-intercept
```
1. Plot y-intercept (0, −1)
2. Use slope 2/3: from (0, −1), rise 2, run 3
3. Plot second point (3, 1)
4. Draw line through points
```

### Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

**Parallel Lines**: Same slope (m₁ = m₂)
- y = 2x + 3 and y = 2x − 5 are parallel

**Perpendicular Lines**: Slopes are negative reciprocals (m₁ · m₂ = −1)
- y = 2x + 1 and y = −(1/2)x + 3 are perpendicular

### Practice Problems

1. Identify slope and y-intercept:
   a) y = 5x + 2
   b) y = −3x − 4
   c) y = (1/2)x

2. Convert to slope-intercept form:
   a) 3x + y = 6
   b) 2x − 4y = 12
   c) x + 5y = 10

3. Graph using slope and y-intercept:
   a) y = 2x + 3
   b) y = −x + 4
   c) y = (3/4)x − 2

4. Determine if parallel, perpendicular, or neither:
   a) y = 3x + 1 and y = 3x − 7
   b) y = 2x + 5 and y = −(1/2)x + 1
   c) y = 4x + 2 and y = −4x + 3

```

**Example 3:** Find equation through (1, 5) and (3, 9)
```
Step 1: Find slope
m = (9 − 5)/(3 − 1) = 4/2 = 2

Step 2: Use point-slope form

y − 5 = 2x − 2
y = 2x + 3
```

**Example 4:** Find equation parallel to y = 3x + 1 through (2, 4)
```
Parallel lines have same slope: m = 3
y − 4 = 3(x − 2)
y = 3x − 2
```

**Example 5:** Find equation perpendicular to y = 2x − 3 through (4, 1)
```
Perpendicular slope: m = −1/2
y − 1 = −(1/2)(x − 4)
y = −(1/2)x + 3
```

   - Use solid line for ≤ or ≥
   - Use dashed line for < or >
2. Choose a test point not on the line (often (0, 0))

2. Test (0, 0): 0 + 0 > 4 → 0 > 4 ✗ FALSE
3. Shade above the line (does not include origin)
```

**Example 3:** Graph 2x − 3y ≥ 6
```
1. Find intercepts: (3, 0) and (0, −2)
2. Graph with solid line
3. Test (0, 0): 2(0) − 3(0) ≥ 6 → 0 ≥ 6 ✗ FALSE
4. Shade the side NOT containing (0, 0)
```

### Practice Problems
