## 2.1 Solve Equations Using the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality

### Learning Objectives
- Verify a solution to an equation (like checking if a stat line is correct)
- Solve equations using the Subtraction Property of Equality
- Solve equations using the Addition Property of Equality
- Solve equations that require simplification
- Translate basketball scenarios into algebraic equations and solve

### Key Concepts

**Definition: Solution of an Equation**
A solution of an equation is a value of a variable that makes a true statement when substituted into the equation. It's like finding the exact number of points a player needs to reach a scoring milestone!

**Subtraction Property of Equality**
For any real numbers a, b, and c: if a = b, then a − c = b − c.
*Just like if both teams score 10 more points, the score difference stays the same!*

**Addition Property of Equality**
For any real numbers a, b, and c: if a = b, then a + c = b + c.
*If you add the same bonus to both teams, they stay tied!*

### Examples

**Example 1: Curry's Scoring Verification**
Stephen Curry needs to verify if scoring 5 three-pointers will give him exactly 13 points from threes in a quarter. Each three-pointer is worth 3 points, but he also made some free throws worth 2 points total. The equation is: 3x − 2 = 13, where x is the number of three-pointers beyond his first shot.

Wait, let's use the original format: Determine whether x = 5 is a solution of 6x − 17 = 13.
*Think of it as: Curry averages 6 points per minute of play. After sitting out 17 points worth of time, did he contribute 13 points in x = 5 minutes?*
```
Substitute x = 5:
6(5) − 17 = 13
30 − 17 = 13
13 = 13 ✓
Yes, x = 5 is a solution! Curry nailed it! 🎯
```

**Example 2: LeBron's Points Needed**
LeBron James has scored y points so far this season. Combined with the 37 points he scored in his last game, his total is actually 37 points behind (-13 compared to last year). Solve: y + 37 = −13
```
y + 37 = −13
y + 37 − 37 = −13 − 37    (Subtract 37 from both sides - like removing that last game)
y = −50

This means before that game, LeBron was 50 points behind last year's pace.
Check: −50 + 37 = −13 ✓
```

**Example 3: Team Scoring Deficit**
The Warriors are down by some points (a). After giving up 28 points in a quarter, they're now down by 37. Solve: a − 28 = −37
```
a − 28 = −37
a − 28 + 28 = −37 + 28    (Add 28 to both sides)
a = −9

The Warriors were only down 9 points before that rough quarter!
Check: −9 − 28 = −37 ✓
```

**Example 4: Calculating Plus/Minus**
A player's plus/minus is calculated from multiple quarters. In a game: 9x − 5 − 8x − 6 = 7, where x represents a scoring factor.
```
9x − 5 − 8x − 6 = 7
x − 11 = 7                 (Combine like terms: 9x - 8x = x, -5 - 6 = -11)
x − 11 + 11 = 7 + 11       (Add 11 to both sides)
x = 18

Check: 9(18) − 5 − 8(18) − 6 = 162 − 5 − 144 − 6 = 7 ✓
```

### Practice Problems - NBA Style! 🏀

1. **Stat Verification** - Determine whether the given value is a solution:
   a) Kevin Durant scores 4 points per possession minus 7 for turnovers. Is x = 3 possessions a solution of 4x − 7 = 5?
   b) Luka Dončić's scoring: Is y = −2 a solution of 3y + 8 = 2?

2. **Solve using subtraction property** (like adjusting scoring):
   a) x + 15 = 23 *(Points needed plus 15 bonus = 23 total)*
   b) n + 42 = −18 *(Team differential)*
   c) p + 3/4 = 1/2 *(Free throw percentage change)*

3. **Solve using addition property** (like adding back stats):
   a) y − 12 = 8 *(Points after deducting 12)*
   b) m − 37 = −54 *(LeBron's scoring pace)*
   c) a − 2.5 = 7.3 *(Assists per game calculation)*

4. **Simplify and solve** (combining quarters):
   a) 5x + 3 − 4x − 7 = 12
   b) 8n − 2 − 7n + 5 = −9

## 2.2 Solve Equations Using the Division and Multiplication Properties of Equality

### Learning Objectives
- Solve equations using the Division Property of Equality (like splitting points among games)
- Solve equations using the Multiplication Property of Equality (like calculating totals)
- Solve equations that require simplification
- Translate NBA scenarios into equations

### Key Concepts

**Division Property of Equality**
For any real numbers a, b, and c (c ≠ 0): if a = b, then a/c = b/c.
*If Curry scores 91 points in 7 games, divide both by 7 to find his average!*

**Multiplication Property of Equality**
For any real numbers a, b, and c: if a = b, then ac = bc.
*If a player averages 15 points, multiply by 6 to find total points in 6 games!*

### Examples

**Example 1: Curry's Scoring Average**
Stephen Curry scored a total of 91 points over 7 games. If 7x = 91, find his points per game (x).
```
7x = 91
7x/7 = 91/7       (Divide both sides by 7)
x = 13 points per game

Check: 7(13) = 91 ✓ Curry averaged 13 PPG in that stretch!
```

**Example 2: Point Differential with Negative Coefficient**
A team's point differential works out to: −12p = 48, where p is a performance factor.
```
−12p = 48
−12p/(−12) = 48/(−12)    (Divide both sides by −12)
p = −4

Check: −12(−4) = 48 ✓
```

**Example 3: Total Points Calculation**
If a player's scoring average divided by 6 equals 15, find the average. Solve n/6 = 15.
*Think: If Giannis's points per 6 minutes is 15, what's his rate?*
```
n/6 = 15
6 · (n/6) = 6 · 15       (Multiply both sides by 6)
n = 90

Check: 90/6 = 15 ✓ That's Giannis-level scoring!
```

**Example 4: Three-Point Shooting Percentage**
Klay Thompson makes 2/3 of his three-point attempts. If (2/3)x = 18 made threes, how many did he attempt?
```
(2/3)x = 18
(3/2) · (2/3)x = (3/2) · 18    (Multiply by reciprocal 3/2)
x = 27 attempts

Check: (2/3)(27) = 18 ✓
Splash Brother Klay: 18/27 = 66.7% from three! 💦
```

### Practice Problems - All-Star Edition! ⭐

1. **Solve using division** (finding averages):
   a) 8x = 56 *(Total points over 8 games)*
   b) −5y = 35 *(Point differential factor)*
   c) 15m = −75 *(Negative plus/minus over 15 minutes)*

2. **Solve using multiplication** (finding totals):
   a) n/4 = 12 *(Points per quarter, find total)*
   b) p/−3 = 7 *(Unusual stat calculation)*
   c) x/0.5 = 16 *(Half-court efficiency)*

3. **Solve with fractions** (shooting percentages):
   a) (3/4)x = 24 *(Making 75% of shots)*
   b) (2/5)y = −8 *(40% success rate)*
   c) −(5/6)n = 15 *(Turnover rate)*

## 2.3 Solve Equations with Variables and Constants on Both Sides

### Learning Objectives
- Solve equations with variables on both sides (comparing two players' stats!)
- Solve equations with parentheses (like calculating complex box scores)

### Strategy - The "Trade" Method
Just like trading players to balance a roster:

1. **Simplify each side** (calculate each player's stats)
2. **Collect variable terms on one side** (get all the "unknowns" together)
3. **Collect constant terms on the other side** (get all the known numbers together)
4. **Isolate the variable** (find the answer!)
5. **Check the solution** (verify the box score)

### Examples

**Example 1: Curry vs. Durant Scoring Race**
Curry scores 5x + 8 points while Durant scores 3x + 14. When do they tie? Solve: 5x + 8 = 3x + 14
```
5x + 8 = 3x + 14
5x − 3x + 8 = 14           (Move 3x to the left - subtract from both sides)
2x + 8 = 14
2x = 14 − 8                (Move 8 to the right)
2x = 6
x = 3

Check: 5(3) + 8 = 3(3) + 14 → 23 = 23 ✓
At x = 3, both players have 23 points! It's a tie game! 🏆
```

**Example 2: Comparing Team Performances**
Team A has 12 − 5y points while Team B has 2y − 9 points. When are they equal?
```
12 − 5y = 2y − 9
12 − 5y − 2y = −9         (Subtract 2y from both sides)
12 − 7y = −9
−7y = −9 − 12             (Subtract 12 from both sides)
−7y = −21
y = 3

Check: 12 − 5(3) = 2(3) − 9 → −3 = −3 ✓
```

**Example 3: Complex Scoring with Bonus Points**
In an All-Star skills challenge, a player earns 3(2x − 5) points in round one and 4x + 7 points in round two. Solve: 3(2x − 5) = 4x + 7
```
3(2x − 5) = 4x + 7
6x − 15 = 4x + 7          (Distribute the 3 - like multiplying bonus)
6x − 4x = 7 + 15
2x = 22
x = 11

Check: 3(2·11 − 5) = 4(11) + 7 → 3(17) = 51 ✓
The player scores 51 points when x = 11!
```

### Practice Problems - Head-to-Head Matchups! 🆚

1. **Player comparisons - solve:**
   a) 7x − 3 = 4x + 12 *(Two players' scoring formulas)*
   b) 9y + 5 = 3y − 7 *(Assist calculations)*
   c) 2n − 8 = 5n + 7 *(Rebound totals)*

2. **Solve with parentheses** (bonus multipliers):
   a) 2(x + 4) = 3x − 1
   b) 5(2y − 3) = 4y + 9
   c) 3(m + 2) = 2(m + 5)

## 2.4 Use a General Strategy to Solve Linear Equations

### The 5-Step Championship Strategy 🏆

Think of solving equations like a basketball game plan:

1. **SIMPLIFY** (Pre-game warmup) - Distribute and combine like terms
2. **COLLECT VARIABLES** (Offense) - Get all variable terms on one side
3. **COLLECT CONSTANTS** (Defense) - Get all constants on the other side
4. **ISOLATE** (The Shot) - Divide or multiply to get the variable alone
5. **CHECK** (Review the Game Film) - Substitute solution into original equation

### Types of Solutions - Game Outcomes

| Solution Type | What It Means | Basketball Analogy |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| One solution | Unique value for x | One clear MVP winner |
| No solution | Contradiction (impossible) | Both teams claiming the same trophy |
| Infinitely many | Always true (identity) | Co-MVPs - everyone wins! |

### Examples

**Example 1: Complex MVP Calculation**
The MVP voting formula: 5(2x − 1) − 3(x + 4) = 2x − 7
```
5(2x − 1) − 3(x + 4) = 2x − 7
10x − 5 − 3x − 12 = 2x − 7       (SIMPLIFY: Distribute)
7x − 17 = 2x − 7                  (Combine like terms)
5x − 17 = −7                      (COLLECT VARIABLES: Subtract 2x)
5x = 10                           (COLLECT CONSTANTS: Add 17)
x = 2                             (ISOLATE: Divide by 5)

CHECK: 5(2·2 − 1) − 3(2 + 4) = 2(2) − 7 → 5(3) − 18 = −3 → −3 = −3 ✓
```

**Example 2: Impossible Game - No Solution**
Can both teams have the same score if: 3(x + 2) = 3x + 1?
```
3(x + 2) = 3x + 1
3x + 6 = 3x + 1
6 = 1   ❌ FALSE!

This is like saying the Warriors scored 6 but also 1 in the same quarter.
IMPOSSIBLE! No solution exists.
```

**Example 3: The Ultimate Tie - Infinite Solutions**
Two identical team strategies: 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6
```
2(x + 3) = 2x + 6
2x + 6 = 2x + 6
6 = 6   ✓ TRUE for ALL values!

This is like two teams running the exact same plays.
They'll always match! Every real number is a solution.
```

## 2.7 Solve Linear Inequalities

### Learning Objectives
- Graph inequalities on a number line (like showing playoff seeding ranges)
- Solve inequalities using properties of equality
- **CRITICAL**: Reverse inequality when multiplying/dividing by negative numbers!

### Key Concepts - The Playoff Picture

**Inequality Symbols** - Think of playoff rankings:
- < less than (Team needs to be ranked BELOW 8th to miss playoffs)
- > greater than (Team needs MORE than 50 wins to clinch)
- ≤ less than or equal (Seed 6 OR BETTER makes playoffs)
- ≥ greater than or equal (Need 41 wins OR MORE for .500 record)

**🚨 THE CRITICAL RULE - DON'T FORGET! 🚨**
When multiplying or dividing by a **NEGATIVE number**, you must **FLIP THE INEQUALITY SIGN**!

*Why? Think about it: If Curry has 4 turnovers and LeBron has 2, Curry > LeBron in turnovers. But in "lack of turnovers" (multiply by -1), LeBron > Curry!*

### Examples

**Example 1: Wins Needed for Playoffs**
A team needs more than 5 additional wins (x) to make playoffs. They currently need x + 4 > 9 wins total.
```
x + 4 > 9
x + 4 − 4 > 9 − 4
x > 5

The team needs MORE than 5 additional wins!
Graph: Open circle at 5, arrow pointing right →
```

**Example 2: Points Per Game Target**
A player wants to maintain 4 points above average, with current stats: 3x − 5 ≤ 7
```
3x − 5 ≤ 7
3x ≤ 12
x ≤ 4

Graph: Closed circle at 4 (≤ means 4 IS included), arrow pointing left ←
```

**Example 3: The Sign Flip! - Turnovers**
Fewer turnovers is BETTER. If −2x > 8 (where x is a "badness" factor):
```
−2x > 8
−2x/(−2) < 8/(−2)    ⚠️ FLIP THE SIGN when dividing by negative!
x < −4

Why flip? Because 4 > 2, but −4 < −2!
Graph: Open circle at −4, arrow pointing left ←
```

**Example 4: Multi-Step - Championship Odds**
Championship probability calculation: 5 − 3x ≥ 17
```
5 − 3x ≥ 17
−3x ≥ 12              (Subtract 5)
x ≤ −4                (Divide by −3, FLIP the sign!)

Graph: CLOSED circle at −4 (≥ became ≤), arrow left ←
```

### Practice Problems - Playoff Race! 🏆

1. **Solve and graph** (playoff scenarios):
   a) x + 7 < 12 *(Games behind leader)*
   b) y − 3 ≥ 8 *(Wins needed)*
   c) 4n + 5 > 21 *(Points required)*

2. **Watch for sign reversal!** 🚨:
   a) −5x < 25 *(Negative factor)*
   b) −3y ≥ 18 *(Deficit calculation)*
   c) 4 − 2x ≤ 12 *(Point differential)*

3. **Multi-step playoff math**:
   a) 3(x + 2) < 15 *(Bonus multiplier)*
   b) 2x − 7 > 5x + 8 *(Comparing teams)*
   c) 4(y − 3) ≤ 2y + 6 *(Scoring inequality)*
