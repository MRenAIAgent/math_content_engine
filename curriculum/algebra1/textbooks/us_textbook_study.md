# US Public School Textbook Study

*Research conducted: January 2026*

## How Textbooks Are Adopted in the US

### Key Questions Answered

| Level | Same Textbooks? | How It Works |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **National** | ❌ No | Each state decides independently. There is no national textbook. |
| **State (e.g., CA)** | ❌ No, but limited | "Adoption states" (CA, TX, FL) approve a list; districts choose from it. "Open territory" states let districts choose freely. |
| **District** | ✅ Usually yes | Districts standardize across their schools for consistency and cost efficiency. |

### State Categories

**Adoption States** (state approves textbook list):
- California, Texas, Florida, and others
- Districts must choose from state-approved list
- Example: California State Board of Education approves textbooks; individual districts select from approved options

**Open Territory States**:
- Districts choose freely with no state-level approval required
