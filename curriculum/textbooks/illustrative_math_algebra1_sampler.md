Illustrative Mathematics is a problem-based core curriculum designed
to address content and practice standards to foster learning for all.
Students learn by doing math, solving problems in mathematical and
real-world contexts, and constructing arguments using precise
language. Teachers can shift their instruction and facilitate student
learning with high-leverage routines to guide learners to understand
and make connections between concepts and procedures.


## What is a Problem-based Curriculum?

In a problem-based curriculum, students work on
carefully crafted and sequenced mathematics problems
during most of the instructional time. Teachers help
students understand the problems and guide discussions
to be sure that the mathematical takeaways are clear to
all. In the process, students explain their ideas and
reasoning and learn to communicate mathematical ideas.
The goal is to give students just enough background and
tools to solve initial problems successfully, and then set
them to increasingly sophisticated problems as their
expertise increases.


The value of a problem-based approach is that students
spend most of their time in math class doing mathematics:
making sense of problems, estimating, trying different
approaches, selecting and using appropriate tools, and
evaluating the reasonableness of their answers. They go


on to interpret the significance of their answers, noticing
patterns and making generalizations, explaining their
reasoning verbally and in writing, listening to the
reasoning of others, and building their understanding.


## Design Principles


### Balancing Conceptual Understanding,

Procedural Fluency, and Applications
These three aspects of mathematical proficiency are interconnected: procedural fluency is
supported by understanding, and deep understanding often requires procedural fluency. In order
to be successful in applying mathematics, students must both understand, and be able to do, the
mathematics.


### Mathematical Practices are the Verbs of Math Class

In a mathematics class, students should not just learn about mathematics, they should do
mathematics. This can be defined as engaging in the mathematical practices: making sense of
problems, reasoning abstractly and quantitatively, making arguments and critiquing the reasoning
of others, modeling with mathematics, making appropriate use of tools, attending to precision in
their use of language, looking for and making use of structure, and expressing regularity in
repeated reasoning.


### Build on What Students Know

New mathematical ideas are built on what students already know about mathematics and the
world, and as they learn new ideas, students need to make connections between them (NRC
2001) . In order to do this, teachers need to understand what knowledge students bring to the
classroom and monitor what they do and do not understand as they are learning. Teachers must
themselves know how the mathematical ideas connect in order to mediate students’ learning.


### Good Instruction Starts with Explicit Learning Goals

Learning goals must be clear not only to teachers, but also to students, and they must influence the
activities in which students participate. Without a clear understanding of what students should be
learning, activities in the classroom, implemented haphazardly, have little impact on advancing
students’ understanding. Strategic negotiation of whole-class discussion on the part of the teacher
during an activity synthesis is crucial to making the intended learning goals explicit. Teachers need
to have a clear idea of the destination for the day, week, month, and year, and select and sequence
instructional activities (or use well-sequenced materials) that will get the class to their destinations.
If you are going to a party, you need to know the address and also plan a route to get there; driving
around aimlessly will not get you where you need to go.


### Different Learning Goals Require

a Variety of Types of Tasks and
Instructional Moves
The kind of instruction that is appropriate at any given
time depends on the learning goals of a particular lesson.
Lessons and activities can:

- provide experience with a new context

- introduce a new concept and associated language

- introduce a new representation

- formalize the definition of a term for an idea previously
encountered informally

- identify and resolve common mistakes and
misconceptions

- practice using mathematical language

- work toward mastery of a concept or procedure

- provide an opportunity to apply mathematics to a
modeling or other application problem


### Each and Every Student Should

Have Access to the Mathematical Work
With proper structures, accommodations, and supports, all
students can learn mathematics. Teachers’ instructional tool
boxes should include knowledge of and skill in implementing
supports for different learners. This curriculum incorporates
extensive tools for specifically supporting English Language
Learners and Students with Disabilities


## Instructional Model


Learning Goals and Targets

### Learning Goals

Teacher-facing learning goals appear at the top of lesson plans. They describe, for a teacher
audience, the mathematical and pedagogical goals of the lesson. Student-facing learning goals
appear in student materials at the beginning of each lesson and start with the word “Let’s.” They
are intended to invite students into the work of that day without giving away too much and spoiling
the problem-based instruction. They are suitable for writing on the board before class begins.


### Learning Targets

These appear in student materials at the end of each unit. They describe, for a student audience,
the mathematical goals of each lesson. Teachers and students might use learning targets in a
number of ways. Some examples include:

- targets for standards-based grading

- prompts for a written reflection as part of a lesson synthesis

- a study aid for self-assessment, review, or catching up after an absence from school

context and what the problem is asking them to do.
- remind students of a context they have seen before.
- get them thinking about where the previous lesson

- preview a calculation that will happen in
the lesson.


Practice Problems
Each lesson includes an associated set of practice problems that may be assigned as homework or for extra practice
in class. They can be collected and scored or used for self-assessment. It is up to teachers to decide which problems
to assign (including assigning none at all).
The design of practice problem sets looks different from many other curricula, but every choice was intentional,
based on learning research, and meant to efficiently facilitate learning. The practice problem set associated with each
lesson includes a few questions about the contents of that lesson, plus additional problems that review material from
earlier in the unit and previous units. Our approach emphasizes distributed practice rather than massed practice

Mathematical Modeling Prompts
Mathematics is a tool for understanding the world better and making decisions. School mathematics instruction often
neglects giving students opportunities to understand this, and reduces mathematics to disconnected rules for moving
symbols around on paper. Mathematical modeling is the process of choosing and using appropriate mathematics and
statistics to analyze empirical situations, to understand them better, and to improve decisions (NGA 2010). This
mathematics will remain important beyond high school in students’ lives and education after high school (NCEE 2013).
- Modeling Prompts can be thought of as a project or assignment. They are meant to be launched in class by a
teacher, but but can be worked on independently or in small groups by students in or out of class.. We built in
maximum flexibility for a teacher to implement these in a way that will work for them.
- The purpose of mathematical modeling is for students to understand that they can use math to better
understand things they are interested in in the world.
- Mathematical modeling is different from solving word problems. There should be room to interpret the problem
and a range of acceptable assumptions and answers. Modeling requires genuine choices to be made by the
modeler.
- Modeling with mathematics is not a solitary activity and students should have support from their teacher and
classmate while assessments focus on providing feedback that helps students improve their modeling skills.

How to Assess Progress
Illustrative Mathematics contains many opportunities and
tools for both formative and summative assessment. Some
things are purely formative, but the tools that can be used
for summative assessment can also be used formatively.

- Each unit begins with a diagnostic assessment
(“Check Your Readiness”) of concepts and skills that
are prerequisite to the unit as well as a few items
that assess what students already know of the key
contexts and concepts that will be addressed by the
unit.

- Each instructional task is accompanied by
commentary about expected student responses
and potential misconceptions so that teachers can
adjust their instruction depending on what students
are doing in response to the task. Often there
are suggested questions to help teachers better

Introduction to Quadratic Functions


Prior Work
Linear, Exponential, and Quadratic Patterns
Prior to this unit, students have studied what it means for a relationship to
be a function, used function notation, and investigated linear and
exponential functions. In this unit, they begin by looking at some patterns
that grow quadratically. They contrast this growth with linear and
exponential growth. They further observe that eventually these quadratic
patterns grow more quickly than linear patterns but more slowly than
exponential patterns.

represented by quadratic functions including area and revenue.

Access to graphing technology is necessary for many activities. Examples
Next, students examine the standard and factored forms of quadratic

Lesson 6-6 Building Quadratic Functions to Describe Situations (Part 2)   285
Lesson Narrative
Previously, students used simple quadratic functions to describe how an
object falls over time given the effect of gravity. In this lesson, they build
on that understanding and construct quadratic functions to represent
projectile motions. Along the way, they learn about the zeros of a function
and the vertex of a graph. They also begin to consider appropriate
domains for a function given the situation it represents.
Students use a linear model to describe the height of an object that is
launched directly upward at a constant speed. Because of the influence of
gravity, however, the object will not continue to travel at a constant rate
(eventually it will stop going higher and will start falling), so the model will
have to be adjusted. MP4
They notice that this phenomenon can be represented with a quadratic
function, and that adding a squared term to the linear term seems to
“bend” the graph and change its direction.

described with a linear function. It also familiarizes students with a
projectile context used in the next activity, in which students will
investigate a quadratic function that more realistically models the
movement of a projectile—with gravity in play.

it is fired? What about 1 minute after it is fired?
4. What domain is appropriate for this function? Explain your reasoning.
The equation is a good model for the height of the cannonball from the time it
is launched, t = 0, until the time it lands, just before t = 20. For times outside
of these values, the function values do not mean anything in the context (for
example, for t = 21 the function would place the cannonball underground).


Are you ready for more?
If the cannonball were fired at 800 feet per second, would it reach a mile in height?
Explain your reasoning.
Sample response: The equation here would be g(t) = 50 + 800t − 16t 2.
Since g(10) = 6,450 and there are 5,280 feet in a mile, this cannonball would
reach over a mile in height. This could also be seen by graphing the function.

going down (or changes from going down to going up). We call this
point the vertex of the graph.
• In the previous activity, we plotted a limited set of points, so we
could not tell where the vertex of the graph was. In this graph, we
are able to identify the vertex. In this situation, the vertex tells us the
maximum height that the cannonball reaches and the number of
seconds after launch that it took before it starts to fall.
• In this graph, we can also see that the height of the cannonball is 0
when t is a little less than 20. That point, the horizontal intercept,
relates to the zero of the function, or an input value that produces 0
for the output. In this situation, the zero tells us when the cannonball
hits the ground.
• Even though we can continue the graph beyond t of 20, in this
situation any output values beyond that point would not have any
meaning. After the cannonball hits the ground, the function is no
longer appropriate for modeling the movement of the cannonball.
Likewise, the function is not appropriate before t = 0 or before the
cannon is fired. In this situation, a domain between 0 and just below
20 seconds is appropriate.

In this lesson, we looked at the height of objects that are launched upward and                                                                                           all statements that are true about the situation.

A. The diver begins 5 meters above the water.
An object is thrown upward from a height of 5 feet with a velocity of 60 feet
per second. Its height h(t) in feet after t seconds is modeled by the function
h(t) = 5 + 60t − 16t 2.                                                                                                                                                     B. The diver begins 3 meters above the water.

b. After 3 hours, will the patient still have at least 10 mcg of
insulin in their body? Explain how you know.
Yes. After 3 hours, the patient has 200 · _                              (2)
b. Will the values of f always be greater than the values of g? Explain how                                                                                                                                                               3

No. Sample response: The values of f are less than the values of g                                                                                        mcg of insulin in their body. This is almost 13 mcg.
when x is 4 or 5, but when x is 6, the value of f is greater than the
value of g. Because f is an exponential function that grows by a
factor of 2, it will eventually overtake a quadratic function like g.
For smaller values of x, the values of f will be smaller than the
values of g.
8. Han accidentally drops his water bottle from the balcony of his apartment
building. The equation d = 32 − 5t 2 gives the distance from the ground, d,
in meters after t seconds. (Lesson 6-5)

b. Is the water bottle falling at a constant speed? Explain how you know.
No. Sample explanation: The change in distance is not the same for
equal intervals of time. Between 0 seconds and 0.5 seconds, the water
bottle dropped 1.25 meters. Between 0.5 seconds and 1 second, the
water bottle dropped 3.75 meters.

Learning Goal Let’s look at the objects being launched in the air.


### Warm Up

6.1 Sky Bound

A cannon is 10 feet off the ground. It launches a cannonball straight up with a
velocity of 406 feet per second.
Imagine that there is no gravity and that the cannonball continues to travel
upward with the same velocity.
1. Complete the table with the heights of the cannonball at different times.

cannonball t seconds after the ball leaves the cannon.
1. What do the terms 50, 312t, and - 16t 2 tell us about the cannonball?


2. Use graphing technology to graph the function. Adjust the graphing
window to the following boundaries: 0 < x < 25 and 0 < y < 2,000.

Summary
Building Quadratic Functions to Describe Situations (Part 2)

In this lesson, we looked at the height of objects that are launched upward and
then come back down because of gravity.
An object is thrown upward from a height of 5 feet with a velocity of 60 feet
per second. Its height h(t) in feet after t seconds is modeled by the function
h(t) = 5 + 60t − 16t 2.
• The linear expression 5 + 60t represents the height the object would have
at time t if there were no gravity. The object would keep going up at the
same speed at which it was thrown. The graph would be a line with a slope
of 60 which relates to the constant speed of 60 feet per second.
• The expression - 16t 2 represents the effect of gravity, which eventually
causes the object to slow down, stop, and start falling back again.
Notice the graph intersects the vertical axis at 5, which                 Here is the graph of h.

the ground. The graph indicates that the object reaches                                   60
its peak height of about 60 feet after a little less than 2                               40
seconds. That peak is the point on the graph where the
function reaches a maximum value. At that point, the
curve changes direction, and the output of the function                                   O      1   2 3 4
changes from increasing to decreasing. We call that                                            Time (seconds)
point the vertex of the graph.
The graph representing any quadratic function is a special kind of “U” shape
called a parabola. You will learn more about the geometry of parabolas in a
future course. Every parabola has a vertex, because there is a point where it
changes direction—from increasing to decreasing, or the other way around.

The object hits the ground a little before 4 seconds. That time corresponds to the
horizontal intercept of the graph. An input value that produces an output of 0 is called a
zero of the function. A zero of the function h is approximately 3.8, because h(3.8) ≈ 0.

In this situation, input values less than 0 seconds or more than about 3.8
seconds would not be meaningful, so an appropriate domain for this function
would include all values of t between 0 and about 3.8.
