## 2.1 Solve Equations Using the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality

### Learning Objectives
- Verify a solution to an equation
- Solve equations using the Subtraction Property of Equality
- Solve equations using the Addition Property of Equality
- Solve equations that require simplification
- Translate word sentences to algebraic equations and solve
- Solve applications using the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality

### Key Concepts

**Definition: Solution of an Equation**
A solution of an equation is a value of a variable that makes a true statement when substituted into the equation.

**Subtraction Property of Equality**
For any real numbers a, b, and c: if a = b, then a − c = b − c.
*Subtracting the same number from both sides of an equation keeps equality.*

**Addition Property of Equality**
For any real numbers a, b, and c: if a = b, then a + c = b + c.
*Adding the same number to both sides of an equation keeps equality.*

### Examples

**Example 1:** Determine whether x = 5 is a solution of 6x − 17 = 13.
```
Substitute x = 5:
6(5) − 17 = 13
30 − 17 = 13
13 = 13 ✓
Yes, x = 5 is a solution.
```

**Example 2:** Solve y + 37 = −13
```
y + 37 = −13
y + 37 − 37 = −13 − 37    (Subtract 37 from both sides)
y = −50

Check: −50 + 37 = −13 ✓
```

**Example 3:** Solve a − 28 = −37
```
a − 28 = −37
a − 28 + 28 = −37 + 28    (Add 28 to both sides)
a = −9

Check: −9 − 28 = −37 ✓
```

**Example 4:** Solve 9x − 5 − 8x − 6 = 7
```
9x − 5 − 8x − 6 = 7
x − 11 = 7                 (Combine like terms)
x − 11 + 11 = 7 + 11       (Add 11 to both sides)
x = 18

Check: 9(18) − 5 − 8(18) − 6 = 162 − 5 − 144 − 6 = 7 ✓
```

### Practice Problems

1. Determine whether the given value is a solution:
   a) Is x = 3 a solution of 4x − 7 = 5?
   b) Is y = −2 a solution of 3y + 8 = 2?

2. Solve using subtraction property:
   a) x + 15 = 23
   b) n + 42 = −18
   c) p + 3/4 = 1/2

3. Solve using addition property:
   a) y − 12 = 8
   b) m − 37 = −54
   c) a − 2.5 = 7.3

4. Simplify and solve:
   a) 5x + 3 − 4x − 7 = 12
   b) 8n − 2 − 7n + 5 = −9

## 2.2 Solve Equations Using the Division and Multiplication Properties of Equality

### Learning Objectives
- Solve equations using the Division Property of Equality
- Solve equations using the Multiplication Property of Equality
- Solve equations that require simplification
- Translate and solve word sentences

### Key Concepts

**Division Property of Equality**
For any real numbers a, b, and c (c ≠ 0): if a = b, then a/c = b/c.

**Multiplication Property of Equality**
For any real numbers a, b, and c: if a = b, then ac = bc.

### Examples

**Example 1:** Solve 7x = 91
```
7x = 91
7x/7 = 91/7       (Divide both sides by 7)
x = 13

Check: 7(13) = 91 ✓
```

**Example 2:** Solve −12p = 48
```
−12p = 48
−12p/(−12) = 48/(−12)    (Divide both sides by −12)
p = −4

Check: −12(−4) = 48 ✓
```

**Example 3:** Solve n/6 = 15
```
n/6 = 15
6 · (n/6) = 6 · 15       (Multiply both sides by 6)
n = 90

Check: 90/6 = 15 ✓
```

**Example 4:** Solve (2/3)x = 18
```
(2/3)x = 18
(3/2) · (2/3)x = (3/2) · 18    (Multiply by reciprocal)
x = 27

Check: (2/3)(27) = 18 ✓
```

### Practice Problems

1. Solve using division:
   a) 8x = 56
   b) −5y = 35
   c) 15m = −75

2. Solve using multiplication:
   a) n/4 = 12
   b) p/−3 = 7
   c) x/0.5 = 16

3. Solve with fractions:
   a) (3/4)x = 24
   b) (2/5)y = −8
   c) −(5/6)n = 15

## 2.3 Solve Equations with Variables and Constants on Both Sides

### Learning Objectives
- Solve equations with variables on both sides
- Solve equations with parentheses

### Strategy

1. Simplify each side (distribute, combine like terms)
2. Collect variable terms on one side
3. Collect constant terms on the other side
4. Isolate the variable
5. Check the solution

### Examples

**Example 1:** Solve 5x + 8 = 3x + 14
```
5x + 8 = 3x + 14
5x − 3x + 8 = 3x − 3x + 14    (Subtract 3x from both sides)
2x + 8 = 14
2x + 8 − 8 = 14 − 8           (Subtract 8 from both sides)
2x = 6
x = 3

Check: 5(3) + 8 = 3(3) + 14 → 23 = 23 ✓
```

**Example 2:** Solve 12 − 5y = 2y − 9
```
12 − 5y = 2y − 9
12 − 5y − 2y = 2y − 2y − 9    (Subtract 2y from both sides)
12 − 7y = −9
12 − 12 − 7y = −9 − 12        (Subtract 12 from both sides)
−7y = −21
y = 3

Check: 12 − 5(3) = 2(3) − 9 → −3 = −3 ✓
```

**Example 3:** Solve 3(2x − 5) = 4x + 7
```
3(2x − 5) = 4x + 7
6x − 15 = 4x + 7              (Distribute)
6x − 4x − 15 = 4x − 4x + 7
2x − 15 = 7
2x = 22
x = 11

Check: 3(2·11 − 5) = 4(11) + 7 → 3(17) = 51 ✓
```

### Practice Problems

1. Solve:
   a) 7x − 3 = 4x + 12
   b) 9y + 5 = 3y − 7
   c) 2n − 8 = 5n + 7

2. Solve with parentheses:
   a) 2(x + 4) = 3x − 1
   b) 5(2y − 3) = 4y + 9
   c) 3(m + 2) = 2(m + 5)

## 2.4 Use a General Strategy to Solve Linear Equations

### General Strategy for Solving Linear Equations

1. **Simplify each side**: Distribute and combine like terms
2. **Collect variables**: Get all variable terms on one side
3. **Collect constants**: Get all constant terms on the other side
4. **Divide or multiply**: Isolate the variable
5. **Check**: Substitute solution into original equation

### Types of Solutions

| Solution Type | Meaning | Example |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| One solution | Unique value for x | 2x + 3 = 7 → x = 2 |
| No solution | Contradiction (identity false) | 2x + 1 = 2x + 5 → 1 = 5 |
| Infinitely many | Identity (always true) | 2x + 4 = 2(x + 2) → 4 = 4 |

### Examples

**Example 1:** Solve 5(2x − 1) − 3(x + 4) = 2x − 7
```
5(2x − 1) − 3(x + 4) = 2x − 7
10x − 5 − 3x − 12 = 2x − 7       (Distribute)
7x − 17 = 2x − 7                  (Combine like terms)
5x − 17 = −7                      (Subtract 2x)
5x = 10                           (Add 17)
x = 2
```

**Example 2:** Solve 3(x + 2) = 3x + 1 (No solution)
```
3(x + 2) = 3x + 1
3x + 6 = 3x + 1
6 = 1   (FALSE!)
No solution.
```

**Example 3:** Solve 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6 (Infinitely many solutions)
```
2(x + 3) = 2x + 6
2x + 6 = 2x + 6
6 = 6   (TRUE for all x!)
All real numbers are solutions.
```

## 2.7 Solve Linear Inequalities

### Learning Objectives
- Graph inequalities on a number line
- Solve inequalities using properties of equality
- Solve inequalities when multiplying or dividing by a negative

### Key Concepts

**Inequality Symbols**
- < less than
- > greater than
- ≤ less than or equal to
- ≥ greater than or equal to

**Important Rule**
When multiplying or dividing both sides by a **negative number**, you must **reverse the inequality sign**.

### Examples

**Example 1:** Solve and graph x + 4 > 9
```
x + 4 > 9
x + 4 − 4 > 9 − 4
x > 5

```
3x − 5 ≤ 7
3x − 5 + 5 ≤ 7 + 5
3x ≤ 12
x ≤ 4

Graph: Closed circle at 4, arrow pointing left
```

**Example 3:** Solve −2x > 8 (Note: dividing by negative!)
```
−2x > 8
−2x/(−2) < 8/(−2)    (Reverse the inequality!)
x < −4

Graph: Open circle at −4, arrow pointing left
```

**Example 4:** Solve 5 − 3x ≥ 17
```
5 − 3x ≥ 17
−3x ≥ 12
x ≤ −4    (Reversed when dividing by −3)
```
