3. **Quadratic Functions** - Parabola properties, vertex form transformations
4. **Factoring** - Area model, visual factor trees
5. **Systems of Equations** - Graphical intersection, substitution flow

### Singapore Math Specific
1. **Bar Models** - Part-whole relationships, comparison models
2. **Number Bonds** - Visual decomposition of numbers
3. **Model Method** - Algebraic word problems with visual bars

### Complex Visualizations
1. **Function Transformations** - Translations, reflections, dilations
2. **Completing the Square** - Geometric interpretation
3. **Polynomial Operations** - Algebra tiles, area models
