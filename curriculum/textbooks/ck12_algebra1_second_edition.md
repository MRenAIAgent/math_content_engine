Introduction - The Language of Algebra
No one likes doing the same problem over and over again—that’s why mathematicians invented algebra.
Algebra takes the basic principles of math and makes them more general, so we can solve a problem once
and then use that solution to solve a group of similar problems.
In arithmetic, you’ve dealt with numbers and their arithmetical operations (such as +, −, ×, ÷). In
algebra, we use symbols called variables (which are usually letters, such as x, y, a, b, c, . . .) to represent
numbers and sometimes processes.
For example, we might use the letter x to represent some number we don’t know yet, which we might need
to ﬁgure out in the course of a problem. Or we might use two letters, like x and y, to show a relationship
between two numbers without needing to know what the actual numbers are. The same letters can represent
a wide range of possible numbers, and the same letter may represent completely diﬀerent numbers when
used in two diﬀerent problems.
Using variables oﬀers advantages over solving each problem “from scratch.” With variables, we can:


- Formulate arithmetical laws such as a + b = b + a for all real numbers a and b.
- Refer to “unknown” numbers. For instance: ﬁnd a number x such that 3x + 1 = 10.
- Write more compactly about functional relationships such as, “If you sell x tickets, then your proﬁt
    will be 3x − 10 dollars, or “ f (x) = 3x − 10,” where “ f ” is the proﬁt function, and x is the input (i.e.
    how many tickets you sell).


**Example 1**

Write an algebraic expression for the perimeter and area of the rectangle below.

To ﬁnd the perimeter, we add the lengths of all 4 sides. We can still do this even if we don’t know the side
lengths in numbers, because we can use variables like l and w to represent the unknown length and width.
If we start at the top left and work clockwise, and if we use the letter P to represent the perimeter, then
we can say:

                                              P=l+w+l+w

We are adding 2 l’s and 2 w’s, so we can say that:

                                               P=2·l+2·w

It’s customary in algebra to omit multiplication symbols whenever possible. For example, 11x means the
same thing as 11 · x or 11 × x. We can therefore also write:

                                                 P = 2l + 2w

Area is length multiplied by width. In algebraic terms we get:

                                        A = l × w → A = l · w → A = lw

Note: 2l + 2w by itself is an example of a variable expression; P = 2l + 2w is an example of an equation.
The main diﬀerence between expressions and equations is the presence of an equals sign (=).
In the above example, we found the simplest possible ways to express the perimeter and area of a rectangle
when we don’t yet know what its length and width actually are. Now, when we encounter a rectangle
whose dimensions we do know, we can simply substitute (or plug in) those values in the above equations.
In this chapter, we will encounter many expressions that we can evaluate by plugging in values for the
variables involved.


Evaluate Algebraic Expressions
When we are given an algebraic expression, one of the most common things we might have to do with it
is evaluate it for some given value of the variable. The following example illustrates this process.

**Example 2**

Let x = 12. Find the value of 2x − 7.
To ﬁnd the solution, we substitute 12 for x in the given expression. Every time we see x, we replace it with
12.

                                              2x − 7 = 2(12) − 7
                                                     = 24 − 7
                                                     = 17

Note: At this stage of the problem, we place the substituted value in parentheses. We do this to make the
written-out problem easier to follow, and to avoid mistakes. (If we didn’t use parentheses and also forgot
to add a multiplication sign, we would end up turning 2x into 212 instead of 2 times 12!)

**Example 3**

Let y = −2. Find the value of 7y − 11y + 2.

**Solution:**

                                       7                    1
                                          − 11(−2) + 2 = −3 + 22 + 2
                                     (−2)                   2
                                                       = 24 − 3
                                                       = 20
Many expressions have more than one variable in them. For example, the formula for the perimeter of
a rectangle in the introduction has two variables: length (l) and width (w). In these cases, be careful to
substitute the appropriate value in the appropriate place.

**Example 5**


The area of a trapezoid is given by the equation A = 2h (a + b). Find the area of a trapezoid with bases
a = 10 cm and b = 15 cm and height h = 8 cm.
To ﬁnd the solution to this problem, we simply take the values given for the variables a, b, and h, and plug
them in to the expression for A:
                         h
                     A = (a + b)     Substitute 10 for a, 15 for b, and 8 for h.
                         8                                                    8
                     A = (10 + 15) Evaluate piece by piece. 10 + 15 = 25; = 4.
                         2                                                    2
                     A = 4(25) = 100

Solution: The area of the trapezoid is 100 square centimeters.


Evaluate Algebraic Expressions with Exponents
Many formulas and equations in mathematics contain exponents. Exponents are used as a short-hand
notation for repeated multiplication. For example:

                                                  2 · 2 = 22
                                               2 · 2 · 2 = 23

The exponent stands for how many times the number is used as a factor (multiplied). When we deal with
integers, it is usually easiest to simplify the expression. We simplify:

                                                     22 = 4
                                                     23 = 8


However, we need exponents when we work with variables, because it is much easier to write x8 than
x · x · x · x · x · x · x · x.
To evaluate expressions with exponents, substitute the values you are given for each variable and simplify.
It is especially important in this case to substitute using parentheses in order to make sure that the
simpliﬁcation is done correctly.

**Example 5**


The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr2 . Find the area of a circle with radius r = 17 inches.
Substitute values into the equation.

                      A = πr2       Substitute 17 for r.
                      A = π(17)2    π · 17 · 17 ≈ 907.9202 . . . Round to 2 decimal places.


The area is approximately 907.92 square inches.

**Example 6**

                     2 3
Find the value of xx3 +y
                       y
                         2 , for x = 2 and y = −4.

Substitute the values of x and y in the following.

                 x 2 y3    (2)2 (−4)3
                        =                     Substitute 2 for x and − 4 for y.
                x3 + y2   (2)3 + (−4)2
                4(−64)    −256    −32
                        =       =            Evaluate expressions: (2)2 = (2)(2) = 4 and
                8 + 16     24       3
                                              (2)3 = (2)(2)(2) = 8. (−4)2 = (−4)(−4) = 16 and
                                              (−4)3 = (−4)(−4)(−4) = −64.


**Example 7**

The height (h) of a ball in ﬂight is given by the formula h = −32t2 + 60t + 20, where the height is given in
feet and the time (t) is given in seconds. Find the height of the ball at time t = 2 seconds.

**Solution:**


                                h = −32t2 + 60t + 20
                                 = −32(2)2 + 60(2) + 20    Substitute 2 for t.
                                 = −32(4) + 60(2) + 20
                                 = 12

The height of the ball is 12 feet.

## 1.2 Order of Operations


### Learning Objectives

- Evaluate algebraic expressions with grouping symbols.
- Evaluate algebraic expressions with fraction bars.
- Evaluate algebraic expressions using a graphing calculator.


Introduction
Look at and evaluate the following expression:

                                              2 + 4 × 7 − 1 =?

How many diﬀerent ways can we interpret this problem, and how many diﬀerent answers could someone
possibly ﬁnd for it?
The simplest way to evaluate the expression is simply to start at the left and work your way across:

                                                 2+4×7−1
                                                 =6×7−1
                                                 = 42 − 1
                                                 = 41

This is the answer you would get if you entered the expression into an ordinary calculator. But if you
entered the expression into a scientiﬁc calculator or a graphing calculator you would probably get 29 as
the answer.
In mathematics, the order in which we perform the various operations (such as adding, multiplying, etc.)
is important. In the expression above, the operation of multiplication takes precedence over addition,
so we evaluate it ﬁrst. Let’s re-write the expression, but put the multiplication in brackets to show that it
is to be evaluated ﬁrst.

                                             2 + (4 × 7) − 1 =?

First evaluate the brackets: 4 × 7 = 28. Our expression becomes:

                                              2 + (28) − 1 =?

When we have only addition and subtraction, we start at the left and work across:

                                                 2 + 28 − 1
                                                  = 30 − 1
                                                  = 29

Algebra students often use the word “PEMDAS” to help remember the order in which we evaluate the
mathematical expressions: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction.

Order of Operations
   1. Evaluate expressions within Parentheses (also all brackets [ ] and braces { }) ﬁrst.
   2. Evaluate all Exponents (terms such as 32 or x3 ) next.
   3. Multiplication and Division is next - work from left to right completing both multiplication and
      division in the order that they appear.
   4. Finally, evaluate Addition and Subtraction - work from left to right completing both addition and
      subtraction in the order that they appear.


Evaluate Algebraic Expressions with Grouping Symbols
The ﬁrst step in the order of operations is called parentheses, but we include all grouping symbols in
this step—not just parentheses (), but also square brackets [ ] and curly braces { }.

**Example 1**

Evaluate the following:
a) 4 − 7 − 11 + 2
b) 4 − (7 − 11) + 2
c) 4 − [7 − (11 + 2)]
Each of these expressions has the same numbers and the same mathematical operations, in the same order.
The placement of the various grouping symbols means, however, that we must evaluate everything in a
diﬀerent order each time. Let’s look at how we evaluate each of these examples.
a) This expression doesn’t have parentheses, exponents, multiplication, or division. PEMDAS states that
we treat addition and subtraction as they appear, starting at the left and working right (it’s NOT addition
then subtraction).

                                       4 − 7 − 11 + 2 = −3 − 11 + 2
                                                      = −14 + 2
                                                      = −12

b) This expression has parentheses, so we ﬁrst evaluate 7 − 11 = −4. Remember that when we subtract a
negative it is equivalent to adding a positive:

                                      4 − (7 − 11) + 2 = 4 − (−4) + 2
                                                       =8+2
                                                       = 10

c) An expression can contain any number of sets of parentheses. Sometimes expressions will have sets
of parentheses inside other sets of parentheses. When faced with nested parentheses, start at the
innermost parentheses and work outward.
Brackets may also be used to group expressions which already contain parentheses. This expression has
both brackets and parentheses. We start with the innermost group: 11 + 2 = 13. Then we complete the
operation in the brackets.

                                     4 − [7 − (11 + 2)] = 4 − [7 − (13)]
                                                         = 4 − [−6]
                                                         = 10


**Example 2**

Evaluate the following:
a) 3 × 5 − 7 ÷ 2
b) 3 × (5 − 7) ÷ 2
c) (3 × 5) − (7 ÷ 2)
a) There are no grouping symbols. PEMDAS dictates that we multiply and divide ﬁrst, working from
left to right: 3 × 5 = 15 and 7 ÷ 2 = 3.5. (NOTE: It’s not multiplication then division.) Next we subtract:

                                           3 × 5 − 7 ÷ 2 = 15 − 3.5
                                                           = 11.5

b) First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 5 − 7 = −2. Then work from left to right:

                                        3 × (5 − 7) ÷ 2 = 3 × (−2) ÷ 2
                                                         = (−6) ÷ 2
                                                         = −3

c) First, we evaluate the expressions inside parentheses: 3 × 5 = 15 and 7 ÷ 2 = 3.5. Then work from left
to right:

                                         (3 × 5) − (7 ÷ 2) = 15 − 3.5
                                                            = 11.5

Note that adding parentheses didn’t change the expression in part c, but did make it easier to read.
Parentheses can be used to change the order of operations in an expression, but they can also be used
simply to make it easier to understand.
We can also use the order of operations to simplify an expression that has variables in it, after we substitute
speciﬁc values for those variables.

**Example 3**

Use the order of operations to evaluate the following:
a) 2 − (3x + 2) when x = 2
b) 3y2 + 2y + 1 when y = −3
c) 2 − (t − 7)2 × (u3 − v) when t = 19, u = 4, and v = 2
a) The ﬁrst step is to substitute the value for x into the expression. We can put it in parentheses to clarify
the resulting expression.

                                                2 − (3(2) + 2)

(Note: 3(2) is the same as 3 × 2.)
Follow PEMDAS - ﬁrst parentheses. Inside parentheses follow PEMDAS again.

       2 − (3 × 2 + 2) = 2 − (6 + 2)    Inside the parentheses, we multiply ﬁrst.
                   2 − 8 = −6           Next we add inside the parentheses, and ﬁnally we subtract.

b) The ﬁrst step is to substitute the value for y into the expression.

                                          3 × (−3)2 + 2 × (−3) − 1

Follow PEMDAS: we cannot simplify the expressions in parentheses, so exponents come next.

               3 × (−3)2 + 2 × (−3) − 1     Evaluate exponents: (−3)2 = 9
               = 3 × 9 + 2 × (−3) − 1       Evaluate multiplication: 3 × 9 = 27; 2 × −3 = −6
               = 27 + (−6) − 1               Add and subtract in order from left to right.
               = 27 − 6 − 1
               = 20

c) The ﬁrst step is to substitute the values for t, u, and v into the expression.

                                           2 − (19 − 7)2 × (43 − 2)

Follow PEMDAS:

         2 − (19 − 7)2 × (43 − 2)    Evaluate parentheses: (19 − 7) = 12; (43 − 2) = (64 − 2) = 62
          = 2 − 122 × 62             Evaluate exponents: 122 = 144
          = 2 − 144 × 62             Multiply: 144 × 62 = 8928
          = 2 − 8928                 Subtract.
          = −8926

In parts (b) and (c) we left the parentheses around the negative numbers to clarify the problem. They did
not aﬀect the order of operations, but they did help avoid confusion when we were multiplying negative
numbers.
Part (c) in the last example shows another interesting point. When we have an expression inside the
parentheses, we use PEMDAS to determine the order in which we evaluate the contents.


Evaluate Algebraic Expressions with Fraction Bars
Fraction bars count as grouping symbols for PEMDAS, so we evaluate them in the ﬁrst step of solving an
expression. All numerators and all denominators can be treated as if they have invisible parentheses around
them. When real parentheses are also present, remember that the innermost grouping symbols come ﬁrst.
If, for example, parentheses appear on a numerator, they would take precedence over the fraction bar. If
the parentheses appear outside of the fraction, then the fraction bar takes precedence.

**Example 4**

Use the order of operations to evaluate the following expressions:

     4 − 1 when z = 2
a) z+3
   (        )
     b+4 − 1 + b when a = 3 and b = 1
b) a+2
       (          )
         w+(x−2z)
c) 2 × (y+2)2 − 1 when w = 11, x = 3, y = 1, and z = −2

a) We substitute the value for z into the expression.

                                                  2+3
                                                      −1
Although this expression has no parentheses, the fraction bar is also a grouping symbol—it has the same
eﬀect as a set of parentheses. We can write in the “invisible parentheses” for clarity:
                                                 (2 + 3)
                                                         −1
Using PEMDAS, we ﬁrst evaluate the numerator:
                                              −1
We can convert 54 to a mixed number:
                                                   5    1
                                                     =1
                                                   4    4
Then evaluate the expression:
                                             5     1    1
                                               −1=1 −1=
                                             4     4    4
b) We substitute the values for a and b into the expression:
                                              (3 + 2    )
                                                     −1 +1
                                               1+4
This expression has nested parentheses (remember the eﬀect of the fraction bar). The innermost grouping
symbol is provided by the fraction bar. We evaluate the numerator (3 + 2) and denominator (1 + 4) ﬁrst.
    (3 + 2    )       (5     )
           −1 +1=        −1 −1       Next we evaluate the inside of the parentheses. First we divide.
     1+4               5
                    = (1 − 1) − 1     Next we subtract.
                    = 0 − 1 = −1

c) We substitute the values for w, x, y, and z into the expression:
   (                 )
     11+(3−2(−2))
2×      (1+2) 2   − 1
This complicated expression has several layers of nested parentheses. One method for ensuring that we
start with the innermost parentheses is to use more than one type of parentheses. Working from the
outside, we can leave the outermost brackets as parentheses (). Next will be the “invisible brackets” from
the fraction bar; we will write these as [ ]. The third level of nested parentheses will be the { }. We will
leave negative numbers in round brackets.
                                             
                  [11 + {3 − 2(−2)}]       
          2 ×         [          ]  − 1   Start with the innermost grouping sign: {} .
                            {1 + 2}2
                                                                 {         }
                                                    {1 + 2} = 3; 3 − 2(−2) = 3 + 4 = 7
                    (                )
                      [11 + 7]
           =2                    −1               Next, evaluate the square brackets.
                         [32 ]
                    ( 18       )
           =2             −1                      Next, evaluate the round brackets. Start with division.
           = 2(2 − 1)                              Finally, do the addition and subtraction.
          = 2(1) = 2

Evaluate Algebraic Expressions with a TI-83/84 Family Graphing
Calculator
A graphing calculator is a very useful tool in evaluating algebraic expressions. Like a scientiﬁc calculator,
a graphing calculator follows PEMDAS. In this section we will explain two ways of evaluating expressions
with the graphing calculator.

**Example 5**

         [                   ]
Evaluate 3(x2 − 1)2 − x4 + 12 + 5x3 − 1 when x = −3.
Method 1: Substitute for the variable ﬁrst. Then evaluate the numerical expression with the calculator.
Substitute the value x = −3 into the expression.
                                 [                          ]
                                  3((−3)2 − 1)2 − (−3)4 + 12 + 5(−3)3 − 1


Input this in the calculator just as it is and press [ENTER]. (Note: use ∧ to enter exponents)


The answer is -13.
Method 2: Input the original expression in the calculator ﬁrst and then evaluate.


First, store the value x = −3 in the calculator. Type -3 [STO] x (The letter x can be entered using the
x−[VAR] button or [ALPHA] + [STO]). Then type the original expression in the calculator and press
[ENTER].
The answer is -13.
The second method is better because you can easily evaluate the same expression for any value you want.
For example, let’s evaluate the same expression using the values x = 2 and x = 23 .


For x = 2, store the value of x in the calculator: 2 [STO] x. Press [2nd] [ENTER] twice to get the
previous expression you typed in on the screen without having to enter it again. Press [ENTER] to
evaluate the expression.
The answer is 62.

For x = 23 , store the value of x in the calculator: 23 [STO] x. Press [2nd] [ENTER] twice to get the
expression on the screen without having to enter it again. Press [ENTER] to evaluate.
The answer is 13.21, or 1070
                         81 in fraction form.
Note: On graphing calculators there is a diﬀerence between the minus sign and the negative sign. When
we stored the value negative three, we needed to use the negative sign which is to the left of the [ENTER]
button on the calculator. On the other hand, to perform the subtraction operation in the expression we
used the minus sign. The minus sign is right above the plus sign on the right.
You can also use a graphing calculator to evaluate expressions with more than one variable.

**Example 7**

Evaluate the expression 3x −4y +x
                          2   2     4
                               1  for x = −2, y = 1.
                          (x+y) 2

**Solution:**


Store the values of x and y: -2 [STO] x, 1 [STO] y. (The letters x and y can be entered using [ALPHA]
+ [KEY].) Input the expression in the calculator. When an expression includes a fraction, be sure to use
              (numerator)
parentheses: (denominator) .

Press [ENTER] to obtain the answer −.88 or − 89 .

## 1.3 Patterns and Equations


### Learning Objectives

- Write an equation.
- Use a verbal model to write an equation.
- Solve problems using equations.


Introduction
In mathematics, and especially in algebra, we look for patterns in the numbers we see. The tools of algebra
help us describe these patterns with words and with equations (formulas or functions). An equation is a
mathematical recipe that gives the value of one variable in terms of another.
For example, if a theme park charges $12 admission, then the number of people who enter the park every
day and the amount of money taken in by the ticket oﬀice are related mathematically, and we can write a
rule to ﬁnd the amount of money taken in by the ticket oﬀice.
In words, we might say “The amount of money taken in is equal to twelve times the number of people who
enter the park.”
We could also make a table. The following table relates the number of people who visit the park and the
total money taken in by the ticket oﬀice.

                      Number of visitors     1      2       3    4    5    6    7
                      Money taken in ($)     12     24      36   48   60   72   84

Clearly, we would need a big table to cope with a busy day in the middle of a school vacation!
A third way we might relate the two quantities (visitors and money) is with a graph. If we plot the money
taken in on the vertical axis and the number of visitors on the horizontal axis, then we would have
a graph that looks like the one shown below. Note that this graph shows a smooth line that includes
non-whole number values of x (e.g. x = 2.5). In real life this would not make sense, because fractions of
people can’t visit a park. This is an issue of domain and range, something we will talk about later.


The method we will examine in detail in this lesson is closer to the ﬁrst way we chose to describe the
relationship. In words we said that “The amount of money taken in is twelve times the number of people
who enter the park.” In mathematical terms we can describe this sort of relationship with variables. A
variable is a letter used to represent an unknown quantity. We can see the beginning of a mathematical
formula in the words:
The amount of money taken in is twelve times the number of people who enter the park.
This can be translated to:

            the amount of money taken in = 12 × (the number of people who enter the park)

We can now see which quantities can be assigned to letters. First we must state which letters (or
variables) relate to which quantities. We call this deﬁning the variables:
Let x = the number of people who enter the theme park.
Let y = the total amount of money taken in at the ticket oﬀice.
We now have a fourth way to describe the relationship: with an algebraic equation.

                                                  y = 12x

Writing a mathematical equation using variables is very convenient. You can perform all of the operations
necessary to solve this problem without having to write out the known and unknown quantities over and
over again. At the end of the problem, you just need to remember which quantities x and y represent.

Write an Equation
An equation is a term used to describe a collection of numbers and variables related through mathemat-
ical operators. An algebraic equation will contain letters that represent real quantities. For example,
if we wanted to use the algebraic equation in the example above to ﬁnd the money taken in for a certain
number of visitors, we would substitute that number for x and then solve the resulting equation for y.

**Example 1**

A theme park charges $12 entry to visitors. Find the money taken in if 1296 people visit the park.
Let’s break the solution to this problem down into steps. This will be a useful strategy for all the problems
in this lesson.
Step 1: Extract the important information.

                         (number of dollars taken in) = 12 × (number of visitors)
                                  (number of visitors) = 1296

Step 2: Translate into a mathematical equation. To do this, we pick variables to stand for the numbers.

                                   Let y = (number of dollars taken in).
                                   Let x = (number of visitors).


                         (number of dollars taken in) = 12 × (number of visitors)
                                                     y = 12 × x

Step 3: Substitute in any known values for the variables.

                                               y = 12 × x
                                               x = 1296
                                                 ∴
                                               y = 12 × 1296

Step 4: Solve the equation.

                                           y = 12 × 1296 = 15552

The amount of money taken in is $15552.
Step 5: Check the result.
If $15552 is taken at the ticket oﬀice and tickets are $12, then we can divide the total amount of money
collected by the price per individual ticket.
                                   (number of people) =           = 1296

1296 is indeed the number of people who entered the park. The answer checks out.

**Example 2**

The following table shows the relationship between two quantities. First, write an equation that describes
the relationship. Then, ﬁnd out the value of b when a is 750.

                               a    0      10       20    30      40       50
                               b    20     40       60     80     100      120

Step 1: Extract the important information.
We can see from the table that every time a increases by 10, b increases by 20. However, b is not simply
twice the value of a. We can see that when a = 0, b = 20, and this gives a clue as to what rule the pattern
follows. The rule linking a and b is:
“To ﬁnd b, double the value of a and add 20.”
Step 2: Translate into a mathematical equation:

                                                 Table 1.1:

 Text                               Translates to                          Mathematical Expression
 “To ﬁnd b”                         →                                      b=
 “double the value of a”            →                                      2a
 “add 20”                           →                                      + 20


Our equation is b = 2a + 20.
Step 3: Solve the equation.
The original problem asks for the value of b when a is 750. When a is 750, b = 2a + 20 becomes
b = 2(750) + 20. Following the order of operations, we get:

                                                b = 2(750) + 20
                                                 = 1500 + 20
                                                 = 1520

Step 4: Check the result.
In some cases you can check the result by plugging it back into the original equation. Other times you
must simply double-check your math. In either case, checking your answer is always a good idea. In this
case, we can plug our answer for b into the equation, along with the value for a, and see what comes out.
1520 = 2(750) + 20 is TRUE because both sides of the equation are equal. A true statement means that
the answer checks out.


Use a Verbal Model to Write an Equation
In the last example we developed a rule, written in words, as a way to develop an algebraic equation.
We will develop this further in the next few examples.

**Example 3**

The following table shows the values of two related quantities.         Write an equation that describes the
relationship mathematically.


                                                  Table 1.2:

 x−value                                                 y−value
  -2                                                     10
 0                                                       0
 2                                                       -10
 4                                                       -20
 6                                                       -30


Step 1: Extract the important information.
We can see from the table that y is ﬁve times bigger than x. The value for y is negative when x is positive,
and it is positive when x is negative. Here is the rule that links x and y:
“y is the negative of ﬁve times the value of x”
Step 2: Translate this statement into a mathematical equation.

                                                  Table 1.3:

 Text                                Translates to                       Mathematical Expression
 “y is”                              →                                   y=
 “negative 5 times the value of x”   →                                   −5x


Our equation is y = −5x.
Step 3: There is nothing in this problem to solve for. We can move to Step 4.
Step 4: Check the result.
In this case, the way we would check our answer is to use the equation to generate our own xy pairs. If
they match the values in the table, then we know our equation is correct. We will plug in -2, 0, 2, 4, and
6 for x and solve for y:

                                                  Table 1.4:

 x                                                       y
  -2                                                     −5(−2) = 10
 0                                                       −5(0) = 0
 2                                                       −5(2) = −10
 4                                                       −5(4) = −20
 6                                                       −5(6) = −30


The y−values in this table match the ones in the earlier table. The answer checks out.

**Example 4**

Zarina has a $100 gift card, and she has been spending money on the card in small regular amounts. She
checks the balance on the card weekly and records it in the following table.


                                               Table 1.5:

 Week Number                                          Balance ($)
 1                                                    100
 2                                                    78
 3                                                    56
 4                                                    34


Write an equation for the money remaining on the card in any given week.
Step 1: Extract the important information.
The balance remaining on the card is not just a constant multiple of the week number; 100 is 100 times
1, but 78 is not 100 times 2. But there is still a pattern: the balance decreases by 22 whenever the week
number increases by 1. This suggests that the balance is somehow related to the amount “-22 times the
week number.”
In fact, the balance equals “-22 times the week number, plus something.” To determine what that something
is, we can look at the values in one row on the table—for example, the ﬁrst row, where we have a balance
of $100 for week number 1.
Step 2: Translate into a mathematical equation.
First, we deﬁne our variables. Let n stand for the week number and b for the balance.
Then we can translate our verbal expression as follows:

                                               Table 1.6:

 Text                               Translates to                       Mathematical Expression
 Balance equals -22 times the       →                                   b = −22n+?
 week number, plus something.


To ﬁnd out what that ? represents, we can plug in the values from that ﬁrst row of the table, where
b = 100 and n = 1. This gives us 100 = −22(1)+?.
So what number gives 100 when you add -22 to it? The answer is 122, so that is the number the ? stands
for. Now our ﬁnal equation is:
                                             b = −22n + 122

Step 3: All we were asked to ﬁnd was the expression. We weren’t asked to solve it, so we can move to
Step 4.
Step 4: Check the result.
To check that this equation is correct, we see if it really reproduces the data in the table. To do that we
plug in values for n:
                               n = 1 → b = −22(1) + 122 = 122 − 22 = 100
                               n = 2 → b = −22(2) + 122 = 122 − 44 = 78
                               n = 3 → b = −22(3) + 122 = 122 − 66 = 56
                               n = 4 → b = −22(4) + 122 = 122 − 88 = 34

The equation perfectly reproduces the data in the table. The answer checks out.

Solve Problems Using Equations
Let’s solve the following real-world problem by using the given information to write a mathematical equation
that can be solved for a solution.

**Example 5**

A group of students are in a room. After 25 students leave, it is found that 23 of the original group is left
in the room. How many students were in the room at the start?
Step 1: Extract the important information
We know that 25 students leave the room.
We know that 23 of the original number of students are left in the room.
We need to ﬁnd how many students were in the room at the start.
Step 2: Translate into a mathematical equation. Initially we have an unknown number of students in the
room. We can refer to this as the original number.
Let’s deﬁne the variable x = the original number of students in the room. After 25 students leave the
room, the number of students in the room is x − 25. We also know that the number of students left is 23 of
x. So we have two expressions for the number of students left, and those two expressions are equal because
they represent the same number. That means our equation is:
                                                  x = x − 25

Step 3: Solve the equation.
Add 25 to both sides.
                                                x − 25 =  x
                                           x − 25 + 25 = x + 25
                                                     x = x + 25

Subtract 32 x from both sides.
                                             2     2  2
                                          x − x = x − x + 25
                                             3     3  3
                                               x = 25

Multiply both sides by 3.
                                               3 · x = 3 · 25
                                                    x = 75

Remember that x represents the original number of students in the room. So, there were 75 students in
the room to start with.
Step 4: Check the answer:
If we start with 75 students in the room and 25 of them leave, then there are 75 − 25 = 50 students left in
the room.

3 of the original number is 3 · 75 = 50.
2                           2

This means that the number of students who are left over equals 32 of the original number. The answer
checks out.
The method of deﬁning variables and writing a mathematical equation is the method you will use the most
in an algebra course. This method is often used together with other techniques such as making a table of
values, creating a graph, drawing a diagram and looking for a pattern.

## 1.4 Equations and Inequalities


### Learning Objectives

- Write equations and inequalities.
- Check solutions to equations.
- Check solutions to inequalities.
- Solve real-world problems using an equation.


Introduction
In algebra, an equation is a mathematical expression that contains an equals sign. It tells us that
two expressions represent the same number. For example, y = 12x is an equation. An inequality is a
mathematical expression that contains inequality signs. For example, y ≤ 12x is an inequality. Inequalities
are used to tell us that an expression is either larger or smaller than another expression. Equations and
inequalities can contain both variables and constants.
Variables are usually given a letter and they are used to represent unknown values. These quantities can
change because they depend on other numbers in the problem.
Constants are quantities that remain unchanged. Ordinary numbers like 2, −3, 43 , and π are constants.
Equations and inequalities are used as a shorthand notation for situations that involve numerical data.
They are very useful because most problems require several steps to arrive at a solution, and it becomes
tedious to repeatedly write out the situation in words.


Write Equations and Inequalities
Here are some examples of equations:

                                                               x
                          3x − 2 = 5      x + 9 = 2x + 5         = 15    x2 + 1 = 10

To write an inequality, we use the following symbols:
> greater than
≥ greater than or equal to
< less than
≤ less than or equal to
, not equal to
Here are some examples of inequalities:
                                                                         3x x
                          3x < 5       4 − x ≤ 2x      x2 + 2x − 1 > 0     ≥ −3
                                                                         4  2

The most important skill in algebra is the ability to translate a word problem into the correct equation
or inequality so you can ﬁnd the solution easily. The ﬁrst two steps are deﬁning the variables and
translating the word problem into a mathematical equation.
Deﬁning the variables means that we assign letters to any unknown quantities in the problem.
Translating means that we change the word expression into a mathematical expression containing vari-
ables and mathematical operations with an equal sign or an inequality sign.

**Example 1**

Deﬁne the variables and translate the following expressions into equations.
a) A number plus 12 is 20.
b) 9 less than twice a number is 33.
c) $20 was one quarter of the money spent on the pizza.

**Solution:**

a) Deﬁne
Let n = the number we are seeking.
Translate
A number plus 12 is 20.

                                                    n + 12 = 20

b) Deﬁne
Let n = the number we are seeking.
Translate
9 less than twice a number is 33.
This means that twice the number, minus 9, is 33.

                                                    2n − 9 = 33

c) Deﬁne

Let m = the money spent on the pizza.
Translate
$20 was one quarter of the money spent on the pizza.
                                                  20 = m

Often word problems need to be reworded before you can write an equation.

**Example 2**

Find the solution to the following problems.
a) Shyam worked for two hours and packed 24 boxes. How much time did he spend on packing one box?
b) After a 20% discount, a book costs $12. How much was the book before the discount?

**Solution:**

a) Deﬁne
Let t = time it takes to pack one box.
Translate
Shyam worked for two hours and packed 24 boxes. This means that two hours is 24 times the time it takes
to pack one box.

                                                   2 = 24t

Solve
                                                       2   1
                                                 t=      =    hours
                                                      24   12
                                            × 60 minutes = 5 minutes

Answer
Shyam takes 5 minutes to pack a box.
b) Deﬁne
Let p = the price of the book before the discount.
Translate
After a 20% discount, the book costs $12. This means that the price minus 20% of the price is $12.

                                               p − 0.20p = 12

Solve

                                      p − 0.20p = 0.8p, so 0.8p = 12
                                              p=      = 15
                                                  0.8

Answer
The price of the book before the discount was $15.

Check
If the original price was $15, then the book was discounted by 20% of $15, or $3. $15 − 3 = $12. The
answer checks out.

**Example 3**

Deﬁne the variables and translate the following expressions into inequalities.
a) The sum of 5 and a number is less than or equal to 2.
b) The distance from San Diego to Los Angeles is less than 150 miles.
c) Diego needs to earn more than an 82 on his test to receive a B in his algebra class.
d) A child needs to be 42 inches or more to go on the roller coaster.

**Solution:**

a) Deﬁne
Let n = the unknown number.
Translate

                                                 5+n≤2

b) Deﬁne
Let d = the distance from San Diego to Los Angeles in miles.
Translate

                                                  d < 150

c) Deﬁne
Let x = Diego’s test grade.
Translate

                                                  x > 82

d) Deﬁne
Let h = the height of child in inches.
Translate:

                                                  h ≥ 42


Check Solutions to Equations
You will often need to check solutions to equations in order to check your work. In a math class, checking
that you arrived at the correct solution is very good practice. We check the solution to an equation by
replacing the variable in an equation with the value of the solution. A solution should result in a true
statement when plugged into the equation.

**Example 4**

Check that the given number is a solution to the corresponding equation.

a) y = −1; 3y + 5 = −2y
b) z = 3; z2 + 2z = 8
c) x = − 12 ; 3x + 1 = x

**Solution:**

Replace the variable in each equation with the given value.
a)                                          3(−1) + 5 = −2(−1)
                                               −3 + 5 = 2
                                                     2=2

This is a true statement. This means that y = −1 is a solution to 3y + 5 = −2y.
b)                                              32 + 2(3) = 8
                                                    9+6=8
                                                       15 = 8

This is not a true statement. This means that z = 3 is not a solution to z2 + 2z = 8 .
c)                                       ( 1)          1
                                       3 − +1=−

                                                2      2

This is a true statement. This means that x = − 12 is a solution to 3x + 1 = x.


Check Solutions to Inequalities
To check the solution to an inequality, we replace the variable in the inequality with the value of the
solution. A solution to an inequality produces a true statement when substituted into the inequality.

**Example 5**

Check that the given number is a solution to the corresponding inequality.
a) a = 10; 20a ≤ 250
b) b = −0.5; 3−b
              b > −4
c) x = 34 ; 4x + 5 ≤ 8

**Solution:**

Replace the variable in each inequality with the given value.
a)                                              20(10) ≤ 250
                                                   200 ≤ 250

This statement is true. This means that a = 10 is a solution to the inequality 20a ≤ 250.
Note that a = 10 is not the only solution to this inequality. If we divide both sides of the inequality by 20,
we can write it as a ≤ 12.5. This means that any number less than or equal to 12.5 is also a solution to
the inequality.

b)
                                              3 − (−0.5)
                                                          > −4
                                                (−0.5)
                                                 3 + 0.5
                                                          > −4
                                                   −0.5
                                                      3.5
                                                    −     > −4
                                                      0.5
                                                      −7 > −4

This statement is false. This means that b = −0.5 is not a solution to the inequality 3−b
                                                                                       b > −4 .
c)                                                 (3)
                                               4     +5≥8
                                                    3+5≥8
                                                           8≥8

This statement is true. It is true because this inequality includes an equals sign; since 8 is equal to
itself, it is also “greater than or equal to” itself. This means that x = 34 is a solution to the inequality
4x + 5 ≤ 8.


Solve Real-World Problems Using an Equation
Let’s use what we have learned about deﬁning variables, writing equations and writing inequalities to solve
some real-world problems.

**Example 6**

Tomatoes cost $0.50 each and avocados cost $2.00 each. Anne buys six more tomatoes than avocados. Her
total bill is $8. How many tomatoes and how many avocados did Anne buy?

**Solution:**

Deﬁne
Let a = the number of avocados Anne buys.
Translate
Anne buys six more tomatoes than avocados. This means that a + 6 = the number of tomatoes.
Tomatoes cost $0.50 each and avocados cost $2.00 each. Her total bill is $8. This means that .50 times
the number of tomatoes plus 2 times the number of avocados equals 8.

                                             0.5(a + 6) + 2a = 8
                                          0.5a + 0.5 · 6 + 2a = 8
                                                         2.5a + 3 = 8
                                                            2.5a = 5
                                                               a=2

Remember that a = the number of avocados, so Anne buys two avocados. The number of tomatoes is
a + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8.
Answer
Anne bought 2 avocados and 8 tomatoes.

Check
If Anne bought two avocados and eight tomatoes, the total cost is: (2 × 2) + (8 × 0.5) = 4 + 4 = 8. The
answer checks out.

**Example 7**

To organize a picnic Peter needs at least two times as many hamburgers as hot dogs. He has 24 hot dogs.
What is the possible number of hamburgers Peter has?

**Solution:**

Deﬁne
Let x = number of hamburgers
Translate
Peter needs at least two times as many hamburgers as hot dogs. He has 24 hot dogs.
This means that twice the number of hot dogs is less than or equal to the number of hamburgers.

                                          2 × 24 ≤ x, or 48 ≤ x

Answer
Peter needs at least 48 hamburgers.
Check
48 hamburgers is twice the number of hot dogs. So more than 48 hamburgers is more than twice the
number of hot dogs. The answer checks out.

## 1.5 Functions as Rules and Tables


### Learning Objectives

- Identify the domain and range of a function.
- Make a table for a function.
- Write a function rule.
- Represent a real-world situation with a function.

Introduction
A function is a rule for relating two or more variables. For example, the price you pay for phone service
may depend on the number of minutes you talk on the phone. We would say that the cost of phone service
is a function of the number of minutes you talk. Consider the following situation.
Josh goes to an amusement park where he pays $2 per ride.
There is a relationship between the number of rides Josh goes on and the total amount he spends that
day: To ﬁgure out the amount he spends, we multiply the number of rides by two. This rule is an example
of a function. Functions usually—but not always—are rules based on mathematical operations. You can
think of a function as a box or a machine that contains a mathematical operation.


Whatever number we feed into the function box is changed by the given operation, and a new number
comes out the other side of the box. When we input diﬀerent values for the number of rides Josh goes on,
we get diﬀerent values for the amount of money he spends.


The input is called the independent variable because its value can be any number. The output is called
the dependent variable because its value depends on the input value.
Functions usually contain more than one mathematical operation. Here is a situation that is slightly more
complicated than the example above.
Jason goes to an amusement park where he pays $8 admission and $2 per ride.
The following function represents the total amount Jason pays. The rule for this function is ”multiply the
number of rides by 2 and add 8.”


When we input diﬀerent values for the number of rides, we arrive at diﬀerent outputs (costs).


These ﬂow diagrams are useful in visualizing what a function is. However, they are cumbersome to use in
practice. In algebra, we use the following short-hand notation instead:

                                             input
                                               ↓
                                             f (x) = y ← output
                                            |{z}
                                           f unction
                                              box

First, we deﬁne the variables:
x = the number of rides Jason goes on

y = the total amount of money Jason spends at the amusement park.
So, x represents the input and y represents the output. The notation f () represents the function or the
mathematical operations we use on the input to get the output. In the last example, the cost is 2 times
the number of rides plus 8. This can be written as a function:

                                                f (x) = 2x + 8

In algebra, the notations y and f (x) are typically used interchangeably. Technically, though, f (x) represents
the function itself and y represents the output of the function.


Identify the Domain and Range of a Function
In the last example, we saw that we can input the number of rides into the function to give us the total
cost for going to the amusement park. The set of all values that we can use for the input is called the
domain of the function, and the set of all values that the output could turn out to be is called the range
of the function. In many situations the domain and range of a function are both simply the set of all
real numbers, but this isn’t always the case. Let’s look at our amusement park example.

**Example 1**

Find the domain and range of the function that describes the situation:
Jason goes to an amusement park where he pays $8 admission and $2 per ride.

**Solution:**

Here is the function that describes this situation:

                                              f (x) = 2x + 8 = y

In this function, x is the number of rides and y is the total cost. To ﬁnd the domain of the function, we
need to determine which numbers make sense to use as the input (x).

- The values have to be zero or positive, because Jason can’t go on a negative number of rides.
- The values have to be integers because, for example, Jason could not go on 2.25 rides.
- Realistically, there must be a maximum number of rides that Jason can go on because the park
    closes, he runs out of money, etc. However, since we aren’t given any information about what that
    maximum might be, we must consider that all non-negative integers are possible values regardless of
    how big they are.

Answer For this function, the domain is the set of all non-negative integers.
To ﬁnd the range of the function we must determine what the values of y will be when we apply the
function to the input values. The domain is the set of all non-negative integers: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...}.
Next we plug these values into the function for x. If we plug in 0, we get 8; if we plug in 1, we get 10; if
we plug in 2, we get 12, and so on, counting by 2s each time. Possible values of y are therefore 8, 10, 12,
14, 16, 18, 20... or in other words all even integers greater than or equal to 8.
Answer The range of this function is the set of all even integers greater than or equal to 8.

**Example 2**

Find the domain and range of the following functions.
a) A ball is dropped from a height and it bounces up to 75% of its original height.

b) y = x2

**Solution:**

a) Let’s deﬁne the variables:
x = original height
y = bounce height
A function that describes the situation is y = f (x) = 0.75x. x can represent any real value greater than
zero, since you can drop a ball from any height greater than zero. A little thought tells us that y can also
represent any real value greater than zero.
Answer
The domain is the set of all real numbers greater than zero. The range is also the set of all real numbers
greater than zero.
b) Since there is no word problem attached to this equation, we can assume that we can use any real
number as a value of x. When we square a real number, we always get a non-negative answer, so y can be
any non-negative real number.
Answer
The domain of this function is all real numbers. The range of this function is all non-negative real numbers.
In the functions we’ve looked at so far, x is called the independent variable because it can be any of the
values from the domain, and y is called the dependent variable because its value depends on x. However,
any letters or symbols can be used to represent the dependent and independent variables. Here are three
diﬀerent examples:
                                                y = f (x) = 3x
                                                R = f (w) = 3w
                                                v = f (t) = 3t

These expressions all represent the same function: a function where the dependent variable is three times
the independent variable. Only the symbols are diﬀerent. In practice, we usually pick symbols for the
dependent and independent variables based on what they represent in the real world—like t for time, d for
distance, v for velocity, and so on. But when the variables don’t represent anything in the real world—or
even sometimes when they do—we traditionally use y for the dependent variable and x for the independent
variable.
For another look at the domain of a function, see the following video, where the narrator solves a sample
problem from the California Standards Test about ﬁnding the domain of an unusual function: http:
//www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRB6s77nx2gI.


Make a Table For a Function
A table is a very useful way of arranging the data represented by a function. We can match the input
and output values and arrange them as a table. For example, the values from Example 1 above can be
arranged in a table as follows:
                                      x   0 1      2    3    4   5    6
                                      y 8   10    12   14   16   18   20

A table lets us organize our data in a compact manner. It also provides an easy reference for looking up
data, and it gives us a set of coordinate points that we can plot to create a graph of the function.


**Example 3**

Make a table of values for the function f (x) = 1x . Use the following numbers for input values: -1, -0.5, -0.2,
-0.1, -0.01, 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.

**Solution:**

Make a table of values by ﬁlling the ﬁrst row with the input values and the next row with the output values
calculated using the given function.

                  x         −1      − 0.5   − 0.2 − 0.1 − 0.01 0.01 0.1                        0.2   0.5 1
                          1  1        1       1    1      1      1    1                         1     1   1
                  f (x) =
                          x −1      −0.5    −0.2 −0.1 −0.01 0.01 0.1                           0.2   0.5 1
                  y         −1      −2       − 5 − 10   − 100 100 10                            5     2   1

When you’re given a function, you won’t usually be told what input values to use; you’ll need to decide
for yourself what values to pick based on what kind of function you’re dealing with. We will discuss how
to pick input values throughout this book.


Write a Function Rule
In many situations, we collect data by conducting a survey or an experiment, and then organize the data
in a table of values. Most often, we want to ﬁnd the function rule or formula that ﬁts the set of values in
the table, so we can use the rule to predict what could happen for values that are not in the table.

**Example 4**

Write a function rule for the following table:

                                Number of CDs          2        4        6        8       10
                                Cost in $             24        48       72       86      120


**Solution:**

You pay $24 for 2 CDs, $48 for 4 CDs, $120 for 10 CDs. That means that each CD costs $12.
We can write a function rule:
Cost = $12 × (number of CDs) or f (x) = 12x

**Example 5**

Write a function rule for the following table:

                                      x     −3   −2        −1       0    1    2   3
                                      y      3     2            1    0   1    2       3


**Solution:**

You can see that a negative number turns into the same number, only positive, while a non-negative number
stays the same. This means that the function being used here is the absolute value function: f (x) =| x |.
Coming up with a function based on a set of values really is as tricky as it looks. There’s no rule that will
tell you the function every time, so you just have to think of all the types of functions you know and guess
which one might be a good ﬁt, and then check if your guess is right. In this book, though, we’ll stick to
writing functions for linear relationships, which are the simplest type of function.

Represent a Real-World Situation with a Function
Let’s look at a few real-world situations that can be represented by a function.

**Example 5**

Maya has an internet service that currently has a monthly access fee of $11.95 and a connection fee of
$0.50 per hour. Represent her monthly cost as a function of connection time.

**Solution:**

Deﬁne
Let x = the number of hours Maya spends on the internet in one month
Let y = Maya’s monthly cost
Translate
The cost has two parts: the one-time fee of $11.95 and the per-hour charge of $0.50. So the total cost is
the ﬂat fee + the charge per hour × the number of hours.
Answer
The function is y = f (x) = 11.95 + 0.50x.

**Example 6**

Alfredo wants a deck build around his pool. The dimensions of the pool are 12 f eet × 24 f eet and the decking
costs $3 per square foot. Write the cost of the deck as a function of the width of the deck.

**Solution:**

Deﬁne
Let x = width of the deck
Let y = cost of the deck
Make a sketch and label it


Translate
You can look at the decking as being formed by several rectangles and squares. We can ﬁnd the areas of
all the separate pieces and add them together:

                      Area = 12x + 12x + 24x + 24x + x2 + x2 + x2 + x2 = 72x + 4x2

To ﬁnd the total cost, we then multiply the area by the cost per square foot ($3).

                                     f (x) = 3(72x + 4x2 ) = 216x + 12x2


**Example 7**


A cell phone company sells two million phones in their ﬁrst year of business. The number of phones they
sell doubles each year. Write a function that gives the number of phones that are sold per year as a function
of how old the company is.

**Solution:**

Deﬁne
Let x = age of company in years
Let y = number of phones that are sold per year
Make a table

                             Age (years)            1 2 3          4        5    6    7
                             Millions of phones     2 4    8       16       32   64   128

Write a function rule
The number of phones sold per year doubles every year, so the ﬁrst year the company sells 2 million
phones, the next year it sells 2 × 2 million, the next year it sells 2 × 2 × 2 million, and so on. You
might remember that when we multiply a number by itself several times we can use exponential notation:
2 = 21 , 2 × 2 = 22 , 2 × 2 × 2 = 23 , and so on. In this problem, the exponent just happens to match the
company’s age in years, which makes our function easy to describe.
Answer

                                               y = f (x) = 2 x

## 1.6 Functions as Graphs


### Learning Objectives

- Graph a function from a rule or table.
- Write a function rule from a graph.
- Analyze the graph of a real world situation.
- Determine whether a relation is a function.


Introduction


We represent functions graphically by plotting points on a coordinate plane (also sometimes called the
Cartesian plane). The coordinate plane is a grid formed by a horizontal number line and a vertical

number line that cross at a point called the origin. The origin has this name because it is the “starting”
location; every other point on the grid is described in terms of how far it is from the origin.
The horizontal number line is called the x−axis and the vertical line is called the y−axis. We can represent
each value of a function as a point on the plane by representing the x−value as a distance along the x−axis
and the y−value as a distance along the y−axis. For example, if the y−value of a function is 2 when the
x−value is 4, we can represent this pair of values with a point that is 4 units to the right of the origin (that
is, 4 units along the x−axis) and 2 units up (2 units in the y−direction).


We write the location of this point as (4, 2).

**Example 1**

Plot the following coordinate points on the Cartesian plane.
a) (5, 3)
b) (-2, 6)
c) (3, -4)
d) (-5, -7)

**Solution:**

Here are all the coordinate points on the same plot.


Notice that we move to the right for a positive x−value and to the left for a negative one, just as we would
on a single number line. Similarly, we move up for a positive y−value and down for a negative one.
The x− and y−axes divide the coordinate plane into four quadrants. The quadrants are numbered counter-
clockwise starting from the upper right, so the plotted point for (a) is in the ﬁrst quadrant, (b) is in the
second quadrant, (c) is in the fourth quadrant, and (d) is in the third quadrant.


Graph a Function From a Rule or Table

If we know a rule or have a table of values that describes a function, we can draw a graph of the function.
A table of values gives us coordinate points that we can plot on the Cartesian plane.

**Example 2**

Graph the function that has the following table of values.


                                         x    −2    −1 0         1    2
                                         y     6       8    10   12   14


**Solution:**

The table gives us ﬁve sets of coordinate points: (-2, 6), (-1, 8), (0, 10), (1, 12), and (2, 14).
To graph the function, we plot all the coordinate points. Since we are not told the domain of the function
or given a real-world context, we can just assume that the domain is the set of all real numbers. To show
that the function holds for all values in the domain, we connect the points with a smooth line (which, we
understand, continues inﬁnitely in both directions).


**Example 3**

Graph the function that has the following table of values.


                                      Side of square       0 1   2    3    4
                                      Area of square       0 1   4    9    16


The table gives us ﬁve sets of coordinate points: (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), and (4, 16).
To graph the function, we plot all the coordinate points. Since we are not told the domain of the function,
we can assume that the domain is the set of all non-negative real numbers. To show that the function
holds for all values in the domain, we connect the points with a smooth curve. The curve does not make
sense for negative values of the independent variable, so it stops at x = 0, but it continues inﬁnitely in the
positive direction.


**Example 4**

Graph the function that has the following table of values.

                                Number of balloons     12 13     14   15   16
                                Cost                   41 44     47   50   53

This function represents the total cost of the balloons delivered to your house. Each balloon is $3 and the
store delivers if you buy a dozen balloons or more. The delivery charge is a $5 ﬂat fee.

**Solution:**

The table gives us ﬁve sets of coordinate points: (12, 41), (13, 44), (14, 47), (15, 50), and (16, 53).
To graph the function, we plot all the coordinate points. Since the x−values represent the number of
balloons for 12 balloons or more, the domain of this function is all integers greater than or equal to 12.
In this problem, the points are not connected by a line or curve because it doesn’tmake sense to have
non-integer values of balloons.


In order to draw a graph of a function given the function rule, we must ﬁrst make a table of values to
give us a set of points to plot. Choosing good values for the table is a skill you’l develop throughout this
course. When you pick values, here are some of the things you should keep in mind.

- Pick only values from the domain of the function.
- If the domain is the set of real numbers or a subset of the real numbers, the graph will be a continuous
    curve.
- If the domain is the set of integers of a subset of the integers, the graph will be a set of points not
    connected by a curve.
- Picking integer values is best because it makes calculations easier, but sometimes we need to pick
    other values to capture all the details of the function.

- Often we start with one set of values. Then after drawing the graph, we realize that we need to pick
       diﬀerent values and redraw the graph.


**Example 5**

Graph the following function: f (x) = |x − 2|

**Solution:**

Make a table of values. Pick a variety of negative and positive values for x. Use the function rule to ﬁnd
the value of y for each value of x. Then, graph each of the coordinate points.

                                                Table 1.8:

 x                                                     y = f (x) =| x − 2 |
  -4                                                   | −4 − 2 |=| −6 |= 6
 -3                                                    | −3 − 2 |=| −5 |= 5
 -2                                                    | −2 − 2 |=| −4 |= 4
 -1                                                    | −1 − 2 |=| −3 |= 3
 0                                                     | 0 − 2 |=| −2 |= 2
 1                                                     | 1 − 2 |=| −1 |= 1
 2                                                     | 2 − 2 |=| 0 |= 0
 3                                                     | 3 − 2 |=| 1 |= 1
 4                                                     | 4 − 2 |=| 2 |= 2
 5                                                     | 5 − 2 |=| 3 |= 3
 6                                                     | 6 − 2 |=| 4 |= 4
 7                                                     | 7 − 2 |=| 5 |= 5
 8                                                     | 8 − 2 |=| 6 |= 6


It is wise to work with a lot of values when you begin graphing. As you learn about diﬀerent types of
functions, you will start to only need a few points in the table of values to create an accurate graph.

**Example 6**

                                        √
Graph the following function: f (x) =       x

**Solution:**

Make a table of values. We know x can’t be negative because we can’t take the square root of a negative
number. The domain is all positive real numbers, so we pick a variety of positive integer values for x. Use
the function rule to ﬁnd the value of y for each value of x.


                                                  Table 1.9:
                                                                         √
 x                                                        y = f (x) =        x
                                                          √
 0                                                        √0 = 0
 1                                                        √1 = 1
 2                                                        √2 ≈ 1.41
 3                                                        √3 ≈ 1.73
 4                                                        √4 = 2
 5                                                        √5 ≈ 2.24
 6                                                        √6 ≈ 2.45
 7                                                        √7 ≈ 2.65
 8                                                        √8 ≈ 2.83
 9                                                          9=3


Note that the range is all positive real numbers.

**Example 7**

The post oﬀice charges 41 cents to send a letter that is one ounce or less and an extra 17 cents for each
additional ounce or fraction of an ounce. This rate applies to letters up to 3.5 ounces.

**Solution:**

Make a table of values. We can’t use negative numbers for x because it doesn’t make sense to have negative
weight. We pick a variety of positive values for x, making sure to include some decimal values because
prices can be decimals too. Then we use the function rule to ﬁnd the value of y for each value of x.


                 x   0   0.2 0.5   0.8 1     1.2 1.5      1.8 2     2.2 2.5      2.8 3     3.2 3.5
                 y 0     41   41   41   41   58     58    58   58   75   75      75   75    92   92

Write a Function Rule from a Graph
Sometimes you’ll need to ﬁnd the equation or rule of a function by looking at the graph of the function.
Points that are on the graph can give you values of dependent and independent variables that are related
to each other by the function rule. However, you must make sure that the rule works for all the points on
the curve. In this course you will learn to recognize diﬀerent kinds of functions and discover the rules for
all of them. For now we’ll look at some simple examples and ﬁnd patterns that will help us ﬁgure out how
the dependent and independent variables are related.

**Example 8**

The graph to the right shows the distance that an ant covers over time. Find the function rule that shows
how distance and time are related to each other.


**Solution:**

Let’s make a table of values of several coordinate points to see if we can spot how they are related to each
other.

                                  Time          0   1    2    3    4   5     6
                                  Distance      0 1.5    3   4.5   6   7.5   9

We can see that for every second the distance increases by 1.5 feet. We can write the function rule as

                                           Distance = 1.5 × time

The equation of the function is f (x) = 1.5x.


**Example 9**

Find the function rule that describes the function shown in the graph.


**Solution:**

Again, we can make a table of values of several coordinate points to identify how they are related to each
other.

                                 x   −4      −3     −2          −1 0         1    2    3       4
                                 y       8    4.5       2        .5 0        .5   5   4.5      8

Notice that the values of y are half of perfect squares: 8 is half of 16 (which is 4 squared), 4.5 is half of 9
(which is 3 squared), and so on. So the equation of the function is f (x) = 21 x2 .

**Example 10**

Find the function rule that shows the volume of a balloon at diﬀerent times, based on the following graph:


(Notice that the graph shows negative time. The negative time can represent what happened on days
before you started measuring the volume.)

**Solution:**

Once again, we make a table to spot the pattern:

                                  Time       −1     0       1        2   3        4        5
                                  Volume 10         5   2.5 1.2          0.6 0.3       0.15

We can see that every day, the volume of the balloon is half what it was the previous day. On day 0,( the        )x
volume is 5; on day 1, the volume is 5 × 12 ; on day 2, it is 5 × 21 × 12 , and in general, on day x it is 5 × 12 .
                                             ( )x
The equation of the function is f (x) = 5 × 12 .

Determine Whether a Relation is a Function
A function is a special kind of relation. In a function, for each input there is exactly one output; in a
relation, there can be more than one output for a given input.
Consider the relation that shows the heights of all students in a class. The domain is the set of people in
the class and the range is the set of heights. This relation is a function because each person has exactly
one height. If any person had more than one height, the relation would not be a function.


Notice that even though the same person can’t have more than one height, it’s okay for more than one
person to have the same height. In a function, more than one input can have the same output, as long as
more than one output never comes from the same input.

**Example 11**

Determine if the relation is a function.
a) (1, 3), (-1, -2), (3, 5), (2, 5), (3, 4)
b) (-3, 20), (-5, 25), (-1, 5), (7, 12), (9, 2)
c)

                                                  x   2   1    0   1   2
                                                  y 12    10   8   6   4


**Solution:**

The easiest way to ﬁgure out if a relation is a function is to look at all the x−values in the list or the table.
If a value of x appears more than once, and it’s paired up with diﬀerent y−values, then the relation is not
a function.
a) You can see that in this relation there are two diﬀerent y−values paired with the x−value of 3. This
means that this relation is not a function.
b) Each value of x has exactly one y−value. The relation is a function.
c) In this relation there are two diﬀerent y−values paired with the x−value of 2 and two y−values paired
with the x−value of 1. The relation is not a function.
When a relation is represented graphically, we can determine if it is a function by using the vertical line
test. If you can draw a vertical line that crosses the graph in more than one place, then the relation is not
a function. Here are some examples.

Not a function. It fails the vertical line test.

## 1.7 Problem-Solving Plan


### Learning Objectives

- Read and understand given problem situations.
- Make a plan to solve the problem.
- Solve the problem and check the results.
- Compare alternative approaches to solving the problem.
- Solve real-world problems using a plan.


Introduction
We always think of mathematics as the subject in school where we solve lots of problems. Problem solving
is necessary in all aspects of life. Buying a house, renting a car, or ﬁguring out which is the better sale are
just a few examples of situations where people use problem-solving techniques. In this book, you will learn
diﬀerent strategies and approaches to solving problems. In this section, we will introduce a problem-solving
plan that will be useful throughout this book.


Read and Understand a Given Problem Situation
The ﬁrst step to solving a word problem is to read and understand the problem. Here are a few questions
that you should be asking yourself:

- What am I trying to ﬁnd out?
- What information have I been given?
- Have I ever solved a similar problem?

This is also a good time to deﬁne any variables. When you identify your knowns and unknowns, it is
often useful to assign them a letter to make notation and calculations easier.


Make a Plan to Solve the Problem
The next step in the problem-solving plan is to develop a strategy. How can the information you know
assist you in ﬁguring out the unknowns?
Here are some common strategies that you will learn:

- Drawing a diagram.
- Making a table.
- Looking for a pattern.
- Using guess and check.
- Working backwards.
- Using a formula.
- Reading and making graphs.
- Writing equations.
- Using linear models.
- Using dimensional analysis.
- Using the right type of function for the situation.

In most problems, you will use a combination of strategies. For example, looking for patterns is a good
strategy for most problems, and making a table and drawing a graph are often used together. The “writing
an equation” strategy is the one you will work with the most in your study of algebra.


Solve the Problem and Check the Results
Once you develop a plan, you can implement it and solve the problem, carrying out all operations to
arrive at the answer you are seeking.
The last step in solving any problem should always be to check and interpret the answer. Ask yourself:

- Does the answer make sense?
- If you plug the answer back into the problem, do all the numbers work out?
- Can you get the same answer through another method?


Compare Alternative Approaches to Solving the Problem
Sometimes one speciﬁc method is best for solving a problem. Most problems, however, can be solved by
using several diﬀerent strategies. When you are familiar with all of the problem-solving strategies, it is
up to you to choose the methods that you are most comfortable with and that make sense to you. In this
book, we will often use more than one method to solve a problem, so we can demonstrate the strengths
and weakness of diﬀerent strategies for solving diﬀerent types of problems.
Whichever strategy you are using, you should always implement the problem-solving plan when you are
solving word problems. Here is a summary of the problem-solving plan.
Step 1:
Understand the problem
Read the problem carefully. Once the problem is read, list all the components and data that are involved.
This is where you will be assigning your variables.
Step 2:
Devise a plan - Translate
Come up with a way to solve the problem. Set up an equation, draw a diagram, make a chart or construct
a table as a start to solve your problem solving plan.
Step 3:
Carry out the plan - Solve

This is where you solve the equation you developed in Step 2.
Step 4:
Look - Check and Interpret
Check to see if you used all your information. Then look to see if the answer makes sense.


Solve Real-World Problems Using a Plan

Let’s now apply this problem solving plan to a problem.

**Example 1**

A coﬀee maker is on sale at 50% oﬀ the regular ticket price. On the “Sunday Super Sale” the same coﬀee
maker is on sale at an additional 40% oﬀ. If the ﬁnal price is $21, what was the original price of the
coﬀee maker?

**Solution:**

Step 1: Understand
We know: A coﬀee maker is discounted 50% and then 40%. The ﬁnal price is $21.
We want: The original price of the coﬀee maker.
Step 2: Strategy
Let’s look at the given information and try to ﬁnd the relationship between the information we know and
the information we are trying to ﬁnd.
50% oﬀ the original price means that the sale price is half of the original or 0.5 × original price.
So, the ﬁrst sale price = 0.5 × original price
A savings of 40% oﬀ the new price means you pay 60% of the new price, or 0.6 × new price.
0.6 × (0.5 × original price) = 0.3 × original price is the price after the second discount.
We know that after two discounts, the ﬁnal price is $21.
So 0.3 × original price = $21.
Step 3: Solve
Since 0.3 × original price = $21, we can ﬁnd the original price by dividing $21 by 0.3.
Original price = $21 ÷ 0.3 = $70.
The original price of the coﬀee maker was $70.
Step 4: Check
We found that the original price of the coﬀee maker is $70.
To check that this is correct, let’s apply the discounts.
50% of $70 = .5 × $70 = $35 savings. So the price after the ﬁrst discount is original price − savings or
$70 − 35 = $35.
Then 40% of that is .4 × $35 = $14. So after the second discount, the price is $35 − 14 = $21.
The answer checks out.

The problem-solving plan used here is based on the ideas of George Pólya, who describes his useful problem-
solving strategies in more detail in the book How to Solve It. Some of the techniques in the book can also

## 1.8 Problem-Solving Strategies: Make a Table

    and Look for a Pattern

### Learning Objectives

- Read and understand given problem situations.
- Develop and use the strategy “make a table.”
- Develop and use the strategy “look for a pattern.”
- Plan and compare alternative approaches to solving a problem.
- Solve real-world problems using the above strategies as part of a plan.


Introduction
In this section, we will apply the problem-solving plan you learned about in the last section to solve several
real-world problems. You will learn how to develop and use the methods make a table and look for a
pattern.

Read and Understand Given Problem Situations
The most diﬀicult parts of problem-solving are most often the ﬁrst two steps in our problem-solving
plan. You need to read the problem and make sure you understand what you are being asked. Once you
understand the problem, you can devise a strategy to solve it.
Let’s apply the ﬁrst two steps to the following problem.
Example 1:
Six friends are buying pizza together and they are planning to split the check equally. After the pizza was
ordered, one of the friends had to leave suddenly, before the pizza arrived. Everyone left had to pay $1
extra as a result. How much was the total bill?

**Solution:**

Understand
We want to ﬁnd how much the pizza cost.
We know that ﬁve people had to pay an extra $1 each when one of the original six friends had to leave.
Strategy
We can start by making a list of possible amounts for the total bill.
We divide the amount by six and then by ﬁve. The total divided by ﬁve should equal $1 more than the
total divided by six.
Look for any patterns in the numbers that might lead you to the correct answer.
In the rest of this section you will learn how to make a table or look for a pattern to ﬁgure out a solution
for this type of problem. After you ﬁnish reading the rest of the section, you can ﬁnish solving this problem
for homework.


Develop and Use the Strategy: Make a Table
The method “Make a Table” is helpful when solving problems involving numerical relationships. When
data is organized in a table, it is easier to recognize patterns and relationships between numbers. Let’s
apply this strategy to the following example.

**Example 2**

Josie takes up jogging. On the ﬁrst week she jogs for 10 minutes per day, on the second week she jogs for
12 minutes per day. Each week, she wants to increase her jogging time by 2 minutes per day. If she jogs
six days each week, what will be her total jogging time on the sixth week?

**Solution:**

Understand
We know in the ﬁrst week Josie jogs 10 minutes per day for six days.
We know in the second week Josie jogs 12 minutes per day for six days.
Each week, she increases her jogging time by 2 minutes per day and she jogs 6 days per week.
We want to ﬁnd her total jogging time in week six.
Strategy
A good strategy is to list the data we have been given in a table and use the information we have been
given to ﬁnd new information.

We are told that Josie jogs 10 minutes per day for six days in the ﬁrst week and 12 minutes per day for
six days in the second week. We can enter this information in a table:

                                               Table 1.10:

 Week                               Minutes per Day                     Minutes per Week
 1                                  10                                  60
 2                                  12                                  72


You are told that each week Josie increases her jogging time by 2 minutes per day and jogs 6 times per
week. We can use this information to continue ﬁlling in the table until we get to week six.

                                               Table 1.11:

 Week                               Minutes per Day                     Minutes per Week
 1                                  10                                  60
 2                                  12                                  72
 3                                  14                                  84
 4                                  16                                  96
 5                                  18                                  108
 6                                  20                                  120


Apply strategy/solve
To get the answer we read the entry for week six.
Answer: In week six Josie jogs a total of 120 minutes.
Check
Josie increases her jogging time by two minutes per day. She jogs six days per week. This means that she
increases her jogging time by 12 minutes per week.
Josie starts at 60 minutes per week and she increases by 12 minutes per week for ﬁve weeks.
That means the total jogging time is 60 + 12 × 5 = 120 minutes.
The answer checks out.
You can see that making a table helped us organize and clarify the information we were given, and helped
guide us in the next steps of the problem. We solved this problem solely by making a table; in many
situations, we would combine this strategy with others to get a solution.


Develop and Use the Strategy: Look for a Pattern
Looking for a pattern is another strategy that you can use to solve problems. The goal is to look for
items or numbers that are repeated or a series of events that repeat. The following problem can be solved
by ﬁnding a pattern.

**Example 3**

You arrange tennis balls in triangular shapes as shown. How many balls will there be in a triangle that has
8 rows?


**Solution:**

Understand
We know that we arrange tennis balls in triangles as shown.
We want to know how many balls there are in a triangle that has 8 rows.
Strategy
A good strategy is to make a table and list how many balls are in triangles of diﬀerent rows.
One row: It is simple to see that a triangle with one row has only one ball.


Two rows: For a triangle with two rows, we add the balls from the top row to the balls from the bottom
row. It is useful to make a sketch of the separate rows in the triangle.


                                                3=1+2

Three rows: We add the balls from the top triangle to the balls from the bottom row.


                                                6=3+3

Now we can ﬁll in the ﬁrst three rows of a table.
                                              Table 1.12:

 Number of Rows                                       Number of Balls
 1                                                    1
 2                                                    3
 3                                                    6


We can see a pattern.
To create the next triangle, we add a new bottom row to the existing triangle.
The new bottom row has the same number of balls as there are rows. (For example, a triangle with 3 rows
has 3 balls in the bottom row.)

To get the total number of balls for the new triangle, we add the number of balls in the old triangle to the
number of balls in the new bottom row.
Apply strategy/solve:
We can complete the table by following the pattern we discovered.
Number of balls = number of balls in previous triangle + number of rows in the new triangle

                                                 Table 1.13:

 Number of Rows                                          Number of Balls
 1                                                       1
 2                                                       3
 3                                                       6

 5                                                       10 + 5 = 15
 6                                                       15 + 6 = 21
 7                                                       21 + 7 = 28
 8                                                       28 + 8 = 36


Answer There are 36 balls in a triangle arrangement with 8 rows.
Check
Each row of the triangle has one more ball than the previous one. In a triangle with 8 rows,
row 1 has 1 ball, row 2 has 2 balls, row 3 has 3 balls, row 4 has 4 balls, row 5 has 5 balls, row 6 has 6 balls,
row 7 has 7 balls, row 8 has 8 balls.
When we add these we get: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36 balls
The answer checks out.
Notice that in this example we made tables and drew diagrams to help us organize our information and
ﬁnd a pattern. Using several methods together is a very common practice and is very useful in solving
word problems.


Plan and Compare Alternative Approaches to Solving Problems
In this section, we will compare the methods of “Making a Table” and “Looking for a Pattern” by using
each method in turn to solve a problem.

**Example 4**

Andrew cashes a $180 check and wants the money in $10 and $20 bills. The bank teller gives him 12 bills.
How many of each kind of bill does he receive?

**Solution:**

Method 1: Making a Table
Understand
Andrew gives the bank teller a $180 check.
The bank teller gives Andrew 12 bills. These bills are a mix of $10 bills and $20 bills.
We want to know how many of each kind of bill Andrew receives.

Strategy
Let’s start by making a table of the diﬀerent ways Andrew can have twelve bills in tens and twenties.
Andrew could have twelve $10 bills and zero $20 bills, or eleven $10 bills and one $20 bill, and so on.
We can calculate the total amount of money for each case.

In the table we listed all the possible ways you can get twelve $10 bills and $20 bills and the total amount
of money for each possibility. The correct amount is given when Andrew has six $10 bills and six $20 bills.
Answer: Andrew gets six $10 bills and six $20 bills.
Check
Six $10 bills and six $20 bills → 6($10) + 6($20) = $60 + $120 = $180
The answer checks out.
Let’s solve the same problem using the method “Look for a Pattern.”
Method 2: Looking for a Pattern
Understand
Andrew gives the bank teller a $180 check.
The bank teller gives Andrew 12 bills. These bills are a mix of $10 bills and $20 bills.
We want to know how many of each kind of bill Andrew receives.
Strategy
Let’s start by making a table just as we did above. However, this time we will look for patterns in the
table that can be used to ﬁnd the solution.
Apply strategy/solve
Let’s ﬁll in the rows of the table until we see a pattern.


                                                Table 1.15:

 $10 bills                          $20 bills                           Total amount
 12                                 0                                   $10(12) + $20(0) = $120
 11                                 1                                   $10(11) + $20(1) = $130
 10                                 2                                   $10(10) + $20(2) = $140


We see that every time we reduce the number of $10 bills by one and increase the number of $20 bills by
one, the total amount increases by $10. The last entry in the table gives a total amount of $140, so we
have $40 to go until we reach our goal. This means that we should reduce the number of $10 bills by four
and increase the number of $20 bills by four. That would give us six $10 bills and six $20 bills.

                                   6($10) + 6($20) = $60 + 120 = $180

Answer: Andrew gets six $10 bills and six $20 bills.
Check
Six $10 bills and six $20 bills → 6($10) + 6($20) = $60 + 120 = $180
The answer checks out.
You can see that the second method we used for solving the problem was less tedious. In the ﬁrst method,
we listed all the possible options and found the answer we were seeking. In the second method, we started
by listing the options, but we found a pattern that helped us ﬁnd the solution faster. The methods of
“Making a Table” and “Looking for a Pattern” are both more powerful if used alongside other problem-
solving methods.


Solve Real-World Problems Using Selected Strategies as Part of
a Plan


**Example 5**

Anne is making a box without a lid. She starts with a 20 in. square piece of cardboard and cuts out four
equal squares from each corner of the cardboard as shown. She then folds the sides of the box and glues the
edges together. How big does she need to cut the corner squares in order to make the box with the biggest
volume?

**Solution:**

Step 1:
Understand

Anne makes a box out of a 20 in × 20 in piece of cardboard.
She cuts out four equal squares from the corners of the cardboard.
She folds the sides and glues them to make a box.
How big should the cut out squares be to make the box with the biggest volume?
Step 2:
Strategy
We need to remember the formula for the volume of a box.
Volume = Area of base × height
Volume = width × length × height
Make a table of values by picking diﬀerent values for the side of the squares that we are cutting out and
calculate the volume.
Step 3:
Apply strategy/solve
Let’s “make” a box by cutting out four corner squares with sides equal to 1 inch. The diagram will look
like this:


You see that when we fold the sides over to make the box, the height becomes 1 inch, the width becomes
18 inches and the length becomes 18 inches.
Volume = width × length × height
Volume = 18 × 18 × 1 = 324 in3
Let’s make a table that shows the value of the box for diﬀerent square sizes:

                                                Table 1.16:

 Side of Square       Box Height           Box Width             Box Length          Volume
 1                    1                    18                    18                  18 × 18 × 1 = 324

 7                    7                    6                     6                   6 × 6 × 7 = 252
 8                    8                    4                     4                   4 × 4 × 8 = 128
 9                    9                    2                     2                   2 × 2 × 9 = 36

                                         Table 1.16: (continued)

 Side of Square       Box Height            Box Width              Box Length         Volume


We stop at a square of 10 inches because at this point we have cut out all of the cardboard and we can’t
make a box any more. From the table we see that we can make the biggest box if we cut out squares with
a side length of three inches. This gives us a volume of 588 in3 .
Answer The box of greatest volume is made if we cut out squares with a side length of three inches.
Step 4:
Check
We see that 588 in3 is the largest volume appearing in the table. We picked integer values for the sides of
the squares that we are cut out. Is it possible to get a larger value for the volume if we pick non-integer
values? Since we get the largest volume for the side length equal to three inches, let’s make another table
with values close to three inches that is split into smaller increments:

                                                 Table 1.17:

Notice that the largest volume is not when the side of the square is three inches, but rather when the side
of the square is 3.3 inches.
Our original answer was not incorrect, but it was not as accurate as it could be. We can get an even more
accurate answer if we take even smaller increments of the side length of the square. To do that, we would
choose smaller measurements that are in the neighborhood of 3.3 inches.
Meanwhile, our ﬁrst answer checks out if we want it rounded to zero decimal places, but a more accurate

answer is 3.3 inches.

# Chapter 2: Real Numbers


## 2.1 Integers and Rational Numbers


### Learning Objectives

- Graph and compare integers.
- Classify and order rational numbers.
- Find opposites of numbers.
- Find absolute values.
- Compare fractions to determine which is bigger.


Introduction
One day, Jason leaves his house and starts walking to school. After three blocks, he stops to tie his shoe
and leaves his lunch bag sitting on the curb. Two blocks farther on, he realizes his lunch is missing and
goes back to get it. After picking up his lunch, he walks six more blocks to arrive at school. How far is the
school from Jason’s house? And how far did Jason actually walk to get there?


Graph and Compare Integers
Integers include the counting numbers (1, 2, 3, ...), the negative counting numbers (-1, -2, -3, ...), and
zero. (You may have learned to think of integers as whole numbers, but technically the “whole numbers”
don’t include the negative integers.)

**Example 1**

Compare the numbers 2 and -5.
When we plot numbers on a number line, the greatest number is farthest to the right, and the least is
farthest to the left.


In the diagram above, we can see that 2 is farther to the right on the number line than -5, so we say that
2 is greater than -5. We use the symbol “>” to mean “greater than”, so we can write 2 > 5.


Classifying Rational Numbers

When we divide an integer a by another integer b (as long as b is not zero) we get a rational number.
It’s called this because it is the ratio of one number to another, and we can write it in fraction form as
a
b . (You may recall that the top number in a fraction is called the numerator and the bottom number is
called the denominator.)
You can think of a rational number as a fraction of a cake. If you cut the cake into b slices, your share is
a of those slices.
For example, when we see the rational number 21 , we can imagine cutting the cake into two parts. Our
share is one of those parts. Visually, the rational number 12 looks like this:


With the rational number 34 , we cut the cake into four parts and our share is three of those parts. Visually,
the rational number 34 looks like this:


The rational number 10  represents nine slices of a cake that has been cut into ten pieces. Visually, the
rational number 10 looks like this:


Proper fractions are rational numbers where the numerator is less than the denominator. A proper
fraction represents a number less than one.
Improper fractions are rational numbers where the numerator is greater than or equal to the denomi-
nator. An improper fraction can be rewritten as a mixed number – an integer plus a proper fraction. For
example, 49 can be written as 2 14 . An improper fraction represents a number greater than or equal to one.
Equivalent fractions are two fractions that represent the same amount. For example, look at a visual
representation of the rational number 42 , and one of the number 12 .

You can see that the shaded regions are the same size, so the two fractions are equivalent. We can convert
one fraction into the other by reducing the fraction, or writing it in lowest terms. To do this, we write
out the prime factors of both the numerator and the denominator and cancel matching factors that appear
in both the numerator and denominator.
                                              2    2·1     1    1
                                                =       =     =
                                              4   2·2·1   2·1   2
Reducing a fraction doesn’t change the value of the fraction—it just simpliﬁes the way we write it. Once
we’ve canceled all common factors, the fraction is in its simplest form.

**Example 2**

Classify and simplify the following rational numbers
a) 37
b) 93
c) 50

**Solution:**

a) 3 and 7 are both prime, so we can’t factor them. That means 37 is already in its simplest form. It is
also a proper fraction.
b) 93 is an improper fraction because 9 > 3. To simplify it, we factor the numerator and denominator and
cancel: 3·3     3
          3·1 = 1 = 3.
c) 50                                                          50    5·5·2     5    5
   60 is a proper fraction, and we can simplify it as follows: 60 = 5·3·2·2 = 3·2 = 6 .


Order Rational Numbers
Ordering rational numbers is simply a matter of arranging them by increasing value—least ﬁrst and greatest
last.

**Example 3**

Put the following fractions in order from least to greatest: 21 , 43 , 23

**Solution:**


2 < 3 < 4
1   2   3

Simple fractions are easy to order—we just know, for example, that one-half is greater than one quarter,
and that two thirds is bigger than one-half. But how do we compare more complex fractions?

**Example 4**

Which is greater, 37 or 49 ?
In order to determine this, we need to rewrite the fractions so we can compare them more easily. If we
rewrite them as equivalent fractions that have the same denominators, then we can compare them directly.
To do this, we need to ﬁnd the lowest common denominator (LCD), or the least common multiple of
the two denominators.

The lowest common multiple of 7 and 9 is 63. Our fraction will be represented by a shape divided into 63
sections. This time we will use a rectangle cut into 9 by 7 = 63 pieces.
7 divides into 63 nine times, so 37 = 9·7
                                      9·3   27
                                          = 63 .
We can multiply the numerator and the denominator both by 9 because that’s really just the opposite of
reducing the fraction—to get back from 27    3
                                       63 to 7 , we’d just cancel out the 9’s. Or, to put that in more
formal terms:

                     c·b are equivalent as long as c , 0.
The fractions ba and c·a
Therefore, 63 is an equivalent fraction to 37 . Here it is shown visually:


9 divides into 63 seven times, so 49 = 7·9
                                       7·4
                                           = 28
                                             63 .
28                              4
63 is an equivalent fraction to 9 . Here it is shown visually:


By writing the fractions with a common denominator of 63, we can easily compare them. If we take
the 28 shaded boxes out of 63 (from our image of 49 above) and arrange them in rows instead of columns,
we can see that they take up more space than the 27 boxes from our image of 73 :


**Solution:**

Since 28                 27 4                   3
      63 is greater than 63 , 9 is greater than 7 .


Graph and Order Rational Numbers
To plot non-integer rational numbers (fractions) on the number line, we can convert them to mixed numbers
(graphing is one of the few occasions in algebra when it’s better to use mixed numbers than improper
fractions), or we can convert them to decimal form.

**Example 5**

Plot the following rational numbers on the number line.
a) 32
b) − 37

c) 17
If we divide up the number line into sub-intervals based on the denominator of the fraction, we can look
at the fraction’s numerator to determine how many of these sub-intervals we need to include.
a) 23 falls between 0 and 1. Because the denominator is 3, we divide the interval between 0 and 1 into three
smaller units. Because the numerator is 2, we count two units over from 0.


b) − 37 falls between 0 and -1. We divide the interval into seven units, and move left from zero by three of
those units.


c) 17                        2
    5 as a mixed number is 3 5 and falls between 3 and 4. We divide the interval into ﬁve units, and move
over two units.


Another way to graph this fraction would be as a decimal. 3 25 is equal to 3.4, so instead of dividing the
interval between 3 and 4 into 5 units, we could divide it into 10 units (each representing a distance of 0.1)
and then count over 4 units. We would end up at the same place on the number line either way.
To make graphing rational numbers easier, try using the number line generator at http://themathworksheetsite.
com/numline.html. You can use it to create a number line divided into whatever units you want, as long
as you express the units in decimal form.


Find the Opposites of Numbers
Every number has an opposite. On the number line, a number and its opposite are, predictably, opposite
each other. In other words, they are the same distance from zero, but on opposite sides of the number line.


The opposite of zero is deﬁned to be simply zero.
The sum of a number and its opposite is always zero—for example, 3 + −3 = 0, 4.2 + −4.2 = 0, and so on.
This is because adding 3 and -3 is like moving 3 steps to the right along the number line, and then 3 steps
back to the left. The number and its opposite cancel each other out, leaving zero.
Another way to think of the opposite of a number is that it is simply the original number multiplied by

-1. The opposite of 4 is 4 × −1 or -4, the opposite of -2.3 is −2.3 × −1 or just 2.3, and so on. Another term
for the opposite of a number is the additive inverse.

**Example 6**

Find the opposite of each of the following:
d) 19.6
e) − 49
f) x
g) xy2
h) (x − 3)

**Solution:**

Since we know that opposite numbers are on opposite sides of zero, we can simply multiply each expression
by -1. This changes the sign of the number to its opposite—if it’s negative, it becomes positive, and vice
versa.
a) The opposite of 19.6 is -19.6.
b) The opposite of is − 94 is 49 .
c) The opposite of x is −x.
d) The opposite of xy2 is −xy2 .
e) The opposite of (x − 3) is −(x − 3), or (3 − x).
Note: With the last example you must multiply the entire expression by -1. A common mistake in this
example is to assume that the opposite of (x − 3) is (x + 3). Avoid this mistake!


Find Absolute Values
When we talk about absolute value, we are talking about distances on the number line. For example, the
number 7 is 7 units away from zero—and so is the number -7. The absolute value of a number is the
distance it is from zero, so the absolute value of 7 and the absolute value of -7 are both 7.
We write the absolute value of -7 as | − 7|. We read the expression |x| as “the absolute value of x.”

- Treat absolute value expressions like parentheses. If there is an operation inside the absolute value
     symbols, evaluate that operation ﬁrst.
- The absolute value of a number or an expression is always positive or zero. It cannot be negative.
     With absolute value, we are only interested in how far a number is from zero, and not in which
     direction.


**Example 7**

Evaluate the following absolute value expressions.
a) |5 + 4|
b) 3 − |4 − 9|
c) | − 5 − 11|
d) −|7 − 22|
(Remember to treat any expressions inside the absolute value sign as if they were inside parentheses, and
evaluate them ﬁrst.)


**Solution:**

a) |5 + 4| = |9| = 9
b) 3 − |4 − 9| = 3 − | − 5| = 3 − 5 = −2
c) | − 5 − 11| = | − 16| = 16
d) −|7 − 22| = −| − 15| = −(15) = −15


Lesson Summary
- Integers (or whole numbers) are the counting numbers (1, 2, 3, ...), the negative counting numbers
     (-1, -2, -3, ...), and zero.
- A rational number is the ratio of one integer to another, like 35 or ab . The top number is called
     the numerator and the bottom number (which can’t be zero) is called the denominator.
- Proper fractions are rational numbers where the numerator is less than the denominator.
- Improper fractions are rational numbers where the numerator is greater than the denominator.
- Equivalent fractions are two fractions that equal the same numerical value. The fractions ba and
     c·b are equivalent as long as c , 0.
     c·a

- To reduce a fraction (write it in simplest form), write out all prime factors of the numerator and
     denominator, cancel common factors, then recombine.
- To compare two fractions it helps to write them with a common denominator.
- The absolute value of a number is the distance it is from zero on the number line. The absolute
     value of any expression will always be positive or zero.
- Two numbers are opposites if they are the same distance from zero on the number line and on
     opposite sides of zero. The opposite of an expression can be found by multiplying the entire
     expression by -1.

Introduction
Ilana buys two identically sized cakes for a party. She cuts the chocolate cake into 24 pieces and the vanilla
cake into 20 pieces, and lets the guests serve themselves. Martin takes three pieces of chocolate cake and

one of vanilla, and Sheena takes one piece of chocolate and two of vanilla. Which of them gets more cake?


Add and Subtract Using a Number Line
In Lesson 1, we learned how to represent numbers on a number line. To add numbers on a number line,
we start at the position of the ﬁrst number, and then move to the right by a number of units equal to the
second number.

**Example 1**

Represent the sum −2 + 3 on a number line.
We start at the number -2, and then move 3 units to the right. We thus end at +1.

**Solution:**

−2 + 3 = 1


**Example 2**

Represent the sum 2 - 3 on a number line.
Subtracting a number is basically just adding a negative number. Instead of moving to the right, we
move to the left. Starting at the number 2, and then moving 3 to the left, means we end at -1.

**Solution:**

2 − 3 = −1


Adding and Subtracting Rational Numbers
When we add or subtract two fractions, the denominators must match before we can ﬁnd the sum or
diﬀerence. We have already seen how to ﬁnd a common denominator for two rational numbers.

**Example 3**

Simplify 53 + 16 .
To combine these fractions, we need to rewrite them over a common denominator. We are looking for the
lowest common denominator (LCD). We need to identify the lowest common multiple or least
common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 6. That is the smallest number that both 5 and 6 divide into evenly
(that is, without a remainder).
The lowest number that 5 and 6 both divide into evenly is 30. The LCM of 5 and 6 is 30, so the lowest
common denominator for our fractions is also 30.
We need to rewrite our fractions as new equivalent fractions so that the denominator in each case is 30.
If you think back to our idea of a cake cut into a number of slices, 35 means 3 slices of a cake that has been

cut into 5 pieces. You can see that if we cut the same cake into 30 pieces (6 times as many) we would need
6 times as many slices to make up an equivalent fraction of the cake—in other words, 18 slices instead of
3.


3                  18
5 is equivalent to 30 .
By a similar argument, we can rewrite the fraction 16 as a share of a cake that has been cut into 30 pieces.
If we cut it into 5 times as many pieces, we need 5 times as many slices.


1                   5
6 is equivalent to 30 .
Now that both fractions have the same denominator, we can add them. If we add 18 pieces of cake to 5
pieces, we get a total of 23 pieces. 23 pieces of a cake that has been cut into 30 pieces means that our
answer is 23
          30 .


                                            3 1  18   5   23
                                             + =    +   =
                                            5 6  30 30    30

Notice that when we have fractions with a common denominator, we add the numerators but we leave
the denominators alone. Here is this information in algebraic terms.
When adding fractions: ac + bc = a+b
                                  c

**Example 4**

Simplify 31 − 19 .
The lowest common multiple of 9 and 3 is 9, so 9 is our common denominator. That means we don’t have
to alter the second fraction at all.

                                      3·3 = 9 . Our sum becomes 9 − 9 . We can subtract fractions with a
3 divides into 9 three times, so 13 = 3·1   3                   3   1

common denominator by subtracting their numerators, just like adding. In other words:
When subtracting fractions: ac − bc = a−b
                                       c

**Solution:**


3 − 9 = 9
1   1   2

So far, we’ve only dealt with examples where it’s easy to ﬁnd the least common multiple of the denominators.
With larger numbers, it isn’t so easy to be sure that we have the LCD. We need a more systematic method.
In the next example, we will use the method of prime factors to ﬁnd the least common denominator.

**Example 5**


Simplify 90 − 126
                  .
To ﬁnd the lowest common multiple of 90 and 126, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the prime factors of 90 and 126. We
do this by continually dividing the number by factors until we can’t divide any further. You may have
seen a factor tree before. (For practice creating factor trees, try the Factor Tree game at http://www.
mathgoodies.com/factors/factor_tree.asp.)
The factor tree for 90 looks like this:


The factor tree for 126 looks like this:


The LCM for 90 and 126 is made from the smallest possible collection of primes that enables us to
construct either of the two numbers. We take only enough instances of each prime to make the number
with the greater number of instances of that prime in its factor tree.

                                                 Table 2.1:

 Prime                       Factors in 90              Factors in 126              We Need
 2                           1                          1                           1
 3                           2                          2                           2
 5                           1                          0                           1
 7                           0                          1                           1


So we need one 2, two 3’s, one 5 and one 7. That gives us 2 · 3 · 3 · 5 · 7 = 630 as the lowest common multiple
of 90 and 126. So 630 is the LCD for our calculation.
90 divides into 630 seven times (notice that 7 is the only factor in 630 that is missing from 90), so
29   7·29   203
90 = 7·90 = 630 .
126 divides into 630 ﬁve times (notice that 5 is the only factor in 630 that is missing from 126), so
 13   5·13    65
126 = 5·126 = 630 .

                             90 − 126 = 630 − 630 = 630 .
Now we complete the problem: 29    13   203    65   138

This fraction simpliﬁes. To be sure of ﬁnding the simplest form for 630 , we write out the prime factors
of the numerator and denominator. We already know the prime factors of 630. The prime factors of 138

are 2, 3 and 23.
138    2·3·23                                                               23       23
630 = 2·3·3·5·7 ; one factor of 2 and one factor of 3 cancels out, leaving 3·5·7 or 105 as our answer.


Identify and Apply Properties of Addition
Three mathematical properties which involve addition are the commutative, associative, and the ad-
ditive identity properties.
Commutative property: When two numbers are added, the sum is the same even if the order of the
items being added changes.
Example: 3 + 2 = 2 + 3
Associative Property: When three or more numbers are added, the sum is the same regardless of how
they are grouped.
Example: (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4)
Additive Identity Property: The sum of any number and zero is the original number.
Example: 5 + 0 = 5


Solve Real-World Problems Using Addition and Subtraction

**Example 6**

Peter is hoping to travel on a school trip to Europe. The ticket costs $2400. Peter has several relatives
who have pledged to help him with the ticket cost. His parents have told him that they will cover half the
cost. His grandma Zenoviea will pay one sixth, and his grandparents in Florida will send him one fourth
of the cost. What fraction of the cost can Peter count on his relatives to provide?
The ﬁrst thing we need to do is extract the relevant information. Peter’s parents will provide 21 the cost;
his grandma Zenoviea will provide 16 ; and his grandparents in Florida 41 . We need to ﬁnd the sum of those
numbers, or 12 + 16 + 14 .
To determine the sum, we ﬁrst need to ﬁnd the LCD. The LCM of 2, 6 and 4 is 12, so that’s our LCD.
Now we can ﬁnd equivalent fractions:
                                                1   6·1    6
                                                  =     =
                                                2   6·2   12
                                                1   2·1    2
                                                  =     =
                                                6   2·6   12
                                                1   3·1    3
                                                  =     =
                                                4   3·4   12
                           6     2    3
Putting them all together: 12 + 12 + 12 = 11
                                          12 .
Peter will get 12 the cost of the trip, or $2200 out of $2400, from his family.

**Example 7**

A property management ﬁrm is buying parcels of land in order to build a small community of condominiums.
It has just bought three adjacent plots of land. The ﬁrst is four-ﬁfths of an acre, the second is ﬁve-twelfths
of an acre, and the third is nineteen-twentieths of an acre. The ﬁrm knows that it must allow one-sixth of
an acre for utilities and a small access road. How much of the remaining land is available for development?
The ﬁrst thing we need to do is extract the relevant information. The plots of land measure 45 , 12
                                                                                                    , and 20

acres, and the ﬁrm can use all of that land except for 61 of an acre. The total amount of land the ﬁrm can

use is therefore 45 + 12   20 − 6 acres.
                         + 19   1

We can add and subtract multiple fractions at once just by ﬁnding a common denominator for all of them.
The factors of 5, 9, 20, and 6 are as follows:

                                              5     5
                                              12     2·2·3
                                              20     2·2·5
                                              6     2·3

We need a 5, two 2’s, and a 3 in our LCD. 2 · 2 · 3 · 5 = 60, so that’s our common denominator. Now to
convert the fractions:

                                              4   12 · 4   48
                                                =        =
                                              5   12 · 5   60
                                             5    5·5      25
                                                =        =
                                            12    5 · 12   60
                                            19    3 · 19   57
                                                =        =
                                            20    3 · 20   60
                                              1   10 · 1   10
                                                =        =
                                              6   10 · 6   60

                          60 + 60 + 60 − 60 =
                                              48+25+57−10
We can rewrite our sum as 48   25   57   10
                                                   60     = 120
                                                            60 .
Next, we need to reduce this fraction. We can see immediately that the numerator is twice the denominator,
so this fraction reduces to 21 or simply 2. One is sometimes called the invisible denominator, because
every whole number can be thought of as a rational number whose denominator is one.

**Solution:**

The property ﬁrm has two acres available for development.


Evaluate Change Using a Variable Expression
When we write algebraic expressions to represent a real quantity, the diﬀerence between two values is the
change in that quantity.

**Example 8**


The intensity of light hitting a detector when it is held a certain distance from a bulb is given by this
equation:

                                              Intensity =
                                                            d2

where d is the distance measured in meters, and intensity is measured in lumens. Calculate the change
in intensity when the detector is moved from two meters to three meters away.
We ﬁrst ﬁnd the values of the intensity at distances of two and three meters.

                                                        3     3
                                       Intensity (2) =    2
                                                            =
                                                       (2)    4
                                                        3     3 1
                                       Intensity (3) =    2
                                                            = =
                                                       (3)    9 3

The diﬀerence in the two values will give the change in the intensity. We move from two meters to
three meters away.
Change = Intensity (3) − Intensity (2) = 13 − 34
To ﬁnd the answer, we will need to write these fractions over a common denominator.
The LCM of 3 and 4 is 12, so we need to rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 12:
                                               1   4·1    4
                                                 =     =
                                               3   4·3   12
                                               3   3·3    9
                                                 =     =
                                               4   3·4   12
So we can rewrite our equation as 12 − 12
                                          = − 12
                                                 . The negative value means that the intensity decreases
as we move from 2 to 3 meters away.

**Solution:**

When moving the detector from two meters to three meters, the intensity falls by 12 lumens.


Lesson Summary
- Subtracting a number is the same as adding the opposite (or additive inverse) of the number.
- To add fractions, rewrite them over the lowest common denominator (LCD). The lowest common
    denominator is the lowest (or least) common multiple (LCM) of the two denominators.
- When adding fractions: ac + bc = a+b  c
- When subtracting fractions: ac − bc = a−b  c
- Commutative property: the sum of two numbers is the same even if the order of the items to be
    added changes.
- Associative Property: When three or more numbers are added, the sum is the same regardless of
    how they are grouped.
- Additive Identity Property: The sum of any number and zero is the original number.
- The number one is sometimes called the invisible denominator, as every whole number can be
    thought of as a rational number whose denominator is one.
- The diﬀerence between two values is the change in that quantity.

## 2.3 Multiplying and Dividing Rational Numbers


### Learning Objectives

- Multiply by negative one.
- Multiply rational numbers.
- Identify and apply properties of multiplication.
- Solve real-world problems using multiplication.
- Find multiplicative inverses.
- Divide rational numbers.
- Solve real-world problems using division.


Multiplying Numbers by Negative One
Whenever we multiply a number by negative one, the sign of the number changes. In more mathematical
terms, multiplying by negative one maps a number onto its opposite. The number line below shows two
examples: 3 · −1 = 3 and −1 · −1 = 1.


When we multiply a number by negative one, the absolute value of the new number is the same as the
absolute value of the old number, since both numbers are the same distance from zero.
The product of a number “x” and negative one is −x. This does not mean that −x is necessarily less than
zero! If x itself is negative, then −x will be positive because a negative times a negative (negative one) is
a positive.
When you multiply an expression by negative one, remember to multiply the entire expression by
negative one.

**Example 1**

Multiply the following by negative one.
a) 79.5
b) π
c) (x + 1)
d) |x|

**Solution:**

a) -79.5
b) −π
c) −(x + 1) or − x − 1
d) −|x|

Note that in the last case the negative sign outside the absolute value symbol applies after the absolute
value. Multiplying the argument of an absolute value equation (the term inside the absolute value symbol)
does not change the absolute value. |x| is always positive. | − x| is always positive. −|x| is always negative.
Whenever you are working with expressions, you can check your answers by substituting in numbers for
the variables. For example, you could check part d of Example 1 by letting x = −3. Then you’d see that
| − 3| , −|3|, because | − 3| = 3 and −|3| = −3.
Careful, though—plugging in numbers can tell you if your answer is wrong, but it won’t always tell you
for sure if your answer is right!


Multiply Rational Numbers

**Example 2**

Simplify 31 · 25 .
One way to solve this is to think of money. For example, we know that one third of sixty dollars is written
as 31 · $60. We can read the above problem as one-third of two-ﬁfths. Here is a visual picture of the fractions
one-third and two-ﬁfths.


If we divide our rectangle into thirds one way and ﬁfths the other way, here’s what we get:


Here is the intersection of the two shaded regions. The whole has been divided into ﬁve pieces width-wise
and three pieces height-wise. We get two pieces out of a total of ﬁfteen pieces.

**Solution:**


3 · 5 = 15
1 2      2

Notice that 1 · 2 = 2 and 3 · 5 = 15. This turns out to be true in general: when you multiply rational
numbers, the numerators multiply together and the denominators multiply together. Or, to put it more
formally:
When multiplying fractions: ab · dc = bd
                                      ac

This rule doesn’t just hold for the product of two fractions, but for any number of fractions.

**Example 4**

Multiply the following rational numbers:
a) 25 · 59
b) 13 · 27 · 25
c) 12 · 23 · 34 · 45


**Solution:**

a) With this problem, we can cancel the ﬁves: 25 · 59 = 2·5   2
                                                        5·9 = 9 .
b) With this problem, we multiply all the numerators and all the denominators:
                                          1 2 2  1·2·2    4
                                           · · =       =
                                          3 7 5  3·7·5   105

c) With this problem, we multiply all the numerators and all the denominators, and then we can cancel
most of them. The 2’s, 3’s, and 4’s all cancel out, leaving 15 .
With multiplication of fractions, we can simplify before or after we multiply. The next example uses factors
to help simplify before we multiply.

**Example 5**


                      25 · 42 .
Evaluate and simplify 12   35


**Solution:**

We can see that 12 and 42 are both multiples of six, 25 and 35 are both multiples of ﬁve, and 35 and 42
are both multiples of 7. That means we can write the whole product as 6·25·5 · 6·7 = 5·5·6·7 . Then we can
                                                                               5·7   6·2·5·7
cancel out the 5, the 6, and the 7, leaving 5 .


Identify and Apply Properties of Multiplication
The four mathematical properties which involve multiplication are the Commutative, Associative,
Multiplicative Identity and Distributive Properties.
Commutative property: When two numbers are multiplied together, the product is the same regardless
of the order in which they are written.
Example: 4 · 2 = 2 · 4


We can see a geometrical interpretation of The Commutative Property of Multiplication to the
right. The Area of the shape (length × width) is the same no matter which way we draw it.
Associative Property: When three or more numbers are multiplied, the product is the same regardless
of their grouping.
Example: 2 · (3 · 4) = (2 · 3) · 4
Multiplicative Identity Property: The product of one and any number is that number.
Example: 5 · 1 = 5
Distributive property: The multiplication of a number and the sum of two numbers is equal to the ﬁrst
number times the second number plus the ﬁrst number times the third number.
Example: 4(6 + 3) = 4 · 6 + 4 · 3

**Example 6**

A gardener is planting vegetables for the coming growing season. He wishes to plant potatoes and has a

choice of a single 8 × 7 meter plot, or two smaller plots of 3 × 7 and 5 × 7 meters. Which option gives him
the largest area for his potatoes?


**Solution:**

In the ﬁrst option, the gardener has a total area of (8 × 7) or 56 square meters.
In the second option, the gardener has (3 × 7) or 21 square meters, plus (5 × 7) or 35 square meters.
21 + 35 = 56, so the area is the same as in the ﬁrst option.


Solve Real-World Problems Using Multiplication

**Example 7**

In the chemistry lab there is a bottle with two liters of a 15% solution of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ). John
removes one-ﬁfth of what is in the bottle, and puts it in a beaker. He measures the amount of H2 O2 and
adds twice that amount of water to the beaker. Calculate the following measurements.
a) The amount of H2 O2 left in the bottle.
b) The amount of diluted H2 O2 in the beaker.
c) The concentration of the H2 O2 in the beaker.

**Solution:**

a) To determine the amount of H2 O2 left in the bottle, we ﬁrst determine the amount that was removed.
That amount was 51 of the amount in the bottle (2 liters). 15 of 2 is 25 .

                                     5 − 5 = 5 liter (or 1.6 liters).
The amount remaining is 2 − 52 , or 10   2   8

There are 1.6 liters left in the bottle.
b) We determined that the amount of the 15% H2 O2 solution removed was 52 liter. The amount of water
added was twice this amount, or 45 liter. So the total amount of solution in the beaker is now 52 + 45 = 65
liter, or 1.2 liters.
There are 1.2 liters of diluted H2 O2 in the beaker.
c) The new concentration of H2 O2 can be calculated.
John started with 52 liter of 15% H2 O2 solution, so the amount of pure H2 O2 is 15% of 25 liters, or
0.15 × 0.40 = 0.06 liters.
After he adds the water, there is 1.2 liters of solution in the beaker, so the concentration of H2 O2 is
0.06    1
 1.2 = 20 or 0.05. To convert to a percent we multiply this number by 100, so the beaker’s contents are
5% H2 O2 .

**Example 8**

Anne has a bar of chocolate and she oﬀers Bill a piece. Bill quickly breaks oﬀ 14 of the bar and eats it.
Another friend, Cindy, takes 13 of what was left. Anne splits the remaining candy bar into two equal pieces
which she shares with a third friend, Dora. How much of the candy bar does each person get?
First, let’s look at this problem visually.

Anne starts with a full candy bar.
Bill breaks oﬀ 14 of the bar.
Cindy takes 13 of what was left.
Dora gets half of the remaining candy bar.
We can see that the candy bar ends up being split four ways, with each person getting an equal amount.

**Solution:**

Each person gets exactly 14 of the candy bar.
We can also examine this problem using rational numbers. We keep a running total of what fraction of
the bar remains. Remember, when we read a fraction followed by of in the problem, it means we multiply
by that fraction.
We start with 1 bar. Then Bill takes 41 of it, so there is 1 − 14 = 34 of a bar left.
Cindy takes 13 of what’s left, or 13 · 34 = 41 of a whole bar. That leaves 34 − 41 = 24 , or 12 of a bar.
That half bar gets split between Anne and Dora, so they each get half of a half bar: 12 · 12 = 14 .
So each person gets exactly 14 of the candy bar.
Extension: If each person’s share is 3 oz, how much did the original candy bar weigh?


Identity Elements
An identity element is a number which, when combined with a mathematical operation on a number,
leaves that number unchanged. For example, the identity element for addition and subtraction is zero,
because adding or subtracting zero to a number doesn’t change the number. And zero is also what you
get when you add together a number and its opposite, like 3 and -3.
The inverse operation of addition is subtraction—when you add a number and then subtract that same
number, you end up back where you started. Also, adding a number’s opposite is the same as subtracting
it—for example, 4 + (−3) is the same as 4 − 3.
Multiplication and division are also inverse operations to each other—when you multiply by a number and
then divide by the same number, you end up back where you started. Multiplication and division also have
an identity element: when you multiply or divide a number by one, the number doesn’t change.

Just as the opposite of a number is the number you can add to it to get zero, the reciprocal of a number
is the number you can multiply it by to get one. And ﬁnally, just as adding a number’s opposite is the same
as subtracting the number, multiplying by a number’s reciprocal is the same as dividing by the number.


Find Multiplicative Inverses
The reciprocal of a number x is also called the multiplicative inverse. Any number times its own
multiplicative inverse equals one, and the multiplicative inverse of x is written as 1x .
To ﬁnd the multiplicative inverse of a rational number, we simply invert the fraction—that is, ﬂip it
over. In other words:
The multiplicative inverse of ab is ba , as long as a , 0.
You’ll see why in the following exercise.

**Example 9**

Find the multiplicative inverse of each of the following.
a) 73
b) 49
c) 3 12
d) − yx
e) 11

**Solution:**

a) When we invert the fraction 37 , we get 73 . Notice that if we multiply 37 · 37 , the 3’s and the 7’s both cancel
out and we end up with 11 , or just 1.
b) Similarly, the inverse of 49 is 94 ; if we multiply those two fractions together, the 4’s and the 9’s cancel out
and we’re left with 1. That’s why the rule “invert the fraction to ﬁnd the multiplicative inverse” works:
the numerator and the denominator always end up canceling out, leaving 1.
c) To ﬁnd the multiplicative inverse of 3 21 we ﬁrst need to convert it to an improper fraction. Three wholes
is six halves, so 3 12 = 62 + 12 = 72 . That means the inverse is 72 .
d) Don’t let the negative sign confuse you. The multiplicative inverse of a negative number is also negative!
Just ignore the negative sign and ﬂip the fraction as usual.
The multiplicative inverse of − yx is − yx .
e) The multiplicative inverse of 11 is 11
                                       1 , or simply 11.
Look again at the last example. When we took the multiplicative inverse of 11  we got a whole number,
11. That’s because we can treat that whole number like a fraction with a denominator of 1. Any number,
even a non-rational one, can be treated this way, so we can always ﬁnd a number’s multiplicative inverse
using the same method.


Divide Rational Numbers
Earlier, we mentioned that multiplying by a number’s reciprocal is the same as dividing by the number.
That’s how we can divide rational numbers; to divide by a rational number, just multiply by that number’s
reciprocal. In more formal terms:

                                                    a c a d
                                                     ÷ = × .
                                                    b d b c


**Example 10**

Divide the following rational numbers, giving your answer in the simplest form.
a) 12 ÷ 14
b) 73 ÷ 23
c) 2x ÷ 4y

         ( )
    2x ÷ − y
d) 11      x


**Solution:**

a) Replace 14 with 41 and multiply: 12 × 14 = 42 = 2.
b) Replace 32 with 32 and multiply: 73 × 32 = 7·3   7
                                              3·2 = 2 .

c) 2x ÷ 4y
            = 2x × 4y    4xy  2xy
                   1 = 2 = 1 = 2xy
         ( )            ( y)     11y
d) 11
    2x ÷   − x
             y  = 11
                  2x  ×  − x = − 2x 2


Solve Real-World Problems Using Division
Speed, Distance and Time
An object moving at a certain speed will cover a ﬁxed distance in a set time. The quantities speed,
distance and time are related through the equation Speed = Distance
                                                            Time .

**Example 11**

Andrew is driving down the freeway. He passes mile marker 27 at exactly mid-day. At 12:35 he passes
mile marker 69. At what speed, in miles per hour, is Andrew traveling?

**Solution:**

To ﬁnd the speed, we need the distance traveled and the time taken. If we want our speed to come out in
miles per hour, we’ll need distance in miles and time in hours.
The distance is 69 − 27 or 42 miles. The time is 35 minutes, or 60
                                                                35                          7
                                                                   hours, which reduces to 12 . Now we can
plug in the values for distance and time into our equation for speed.
                                 42       7    42 12    6 · 7 · 12   6 · 12
                         Speed = 7 = 42 ÷    =    ×   =            =        = 72
                                          12    1   7      1 · 7       1

Andrew is driving at 72 miles per hour.

**Example 12**

Anne runs a mile and a half in a quarter hour. What is her speed in miles per hour?

**Solution:**

We already have the distance and time in the correct units (miles and hours), so we just need to write
them as fractions and plug them into the equation.
                                         1 12       3 1 3 4  3·4   12
                               Speed =          =    ÷ = × =     =    =6
                                                    2 4 2 1  2·1    2

Anne runs at 6 miles per hour.
Example 13 – Newton’s Second Law
Newton’s second law (F = ma) relates the force applied to a body in Newtons (F), the mass of the body in
kilograms (m) and the acceleration in meters per second squared (a). Calculate the resulting acceleration if
a Force of 7 13 Newtons is applied to a mass of 15 kg.

**Solution:**

First, we rearrange our equation to isolate the acceleration, a. If F = ma, dividing both sides by m gives
us a = mF . Then we substitute in the known values for F and m:
                                             7 31       22 1  22 5   110
                                       a=     1
                                                    =     ÷ =    × =
                                                        3  5   3  1   3

The resultant acceleration is 36 23 m/s2 .


Lesson Summary
When multiplying an expression by negative one, remember to multiply the entire expression by negative
one.
To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators: ab · dc = bd
                                                                                        ac

The multiplicative properties are:

- Commutative Property: The product of two numbers is the same whichever order the items to
     be multiplied are written. Example: 2 · 3 = 3 · 2
- Associative Property: When three or more numbers are multiplied, the sum is the same regardless
     of how they are grouped. Example: 2 · (3 · 4) = (2 · 3) · 4
- Multiplicative Identity Property: The product of any number and one is the original number.
     Example: 2 · 1 = 2
- Distributive property: The multiplication of a number and the sum of two numbers is equal to
     the ﬁrst number times the second number plus the ﬁrst number times the third number. Example:
     4(2 + 3) = 4(2) + 4(3)

The multiplicative inverse of a number is the number which produces 1 when multiplied by the original
number. The multiplicative inverse of x is the reciprocal 1x . To ﬁnd the multiplicative inverse of a fraction,
simply invert the fraction: ab inverts to ba .
To divide fractions, invert the divisor and multiply: ab ÷ dc = ab × dc .

## 2.4 The Distributive Property


### Learning Objectives

- Apply the distributive property.
- Identify parts of an expression.
- Solve real-world problems using the distributive property.

Introduction
At the end of the school year, an elementary school teacher makes a little gift bag for each of his students.
Each bag contains one class photograph, two party favors and ﬁve pieces of candy. The teacher will
distribute the bags among his 28 students. How many of each item does the teacher need?


Apply the Distributive Property
When we have a problem like the one posed in the introduction, The Distributive Property can help
us solve it. First, we can write an expression for the contents of each bag: Items = (photo + 2 favors + 5
candies), or simply I = (p + 2 f + 5c).
For all 28 students, the teacher will need 28 times that number of items, so I = 28(p + 2 f + 5c).
Next, the Distributive Property of Multiplication tells us that when we have a single term multiplied
by a sum of several terms, we can rewrite it by multiplying the single term by each of the other terms
separately. In other words, 28(p + 2 f + 5c) = 28(p) + 28(2 f ) + 28(5c), which simpliﬁes to 28p + 56 f + 140c.
So the teacher needs 28 class photos, 56 party favors and 140 pieces of candy.
You can see why the Distributive Property works by looking at a simple problem where we just have
numbers inside the parentheses, and considering the Order of Operations.

**Example 1**

Determine the value of 11(2 - 6) using both the Order of Operations and the Distributive Property.

**Solution:**

Order of Operations tells us to evaluate the amount inside the parentheses ﬁrst:

                                               11(2 − 6) = 11(−4) = −44

Now let’s try it with the Distributive Property:

                                     11(2 − 6) = 11(2) − 11(6) = 22 − 66 = −44

Note: When applying the Distributive Property you MUST take note of any negative signs!

**Example 2**

Use the Distributive Property to determine the following.
a) 11(2x + 6)
b) 7(3x − 5)
c) 72 (3y2 − 11)
        (           )
d) 2x     3y 2 − 11
     7           xy

**Solution:**

a) 11(2x + 6) = 11(2x) + 11(6) = 22x + 66
b) Note the negative sign on the second term.

                                                 7(3x − 5) = 21x − 35

                                           2            6y −22
c) 72 (3y2 − 11) = 27 (3y2 ) + 27 (−11) = 6y7 − 22
                                                 7 , or    7

      (      )              (    ) 6xy2
   7 3y − xy = 7 (3y ) + 7 − xy = 7 − 7xy
d) 2x   2 11   2x   2    2x   11        22x

We can simplify this answer by canceling the x’s in the second fraction, so we end up with 6xy
                                                                                            7 − 7y .


Identify Expressions That Involve the Distributive Property
The Distributive Property can also appear in expressions that don’t include parentheses. In Lesson 1.2,
we saw how the fraction bar also acts as a grouping symbol. Now we’ll see how to use the Distributive
Property with fractions.

**Example 3**

Simplify the following expressions.
a) 2x+8

b) 9y−2
c) z+6

**Solution:**

Even though these expressions aren’t written in a form we usually associate with the Distributive Property,
remember that we treat the numerator of a fraction as if it were in parentheses, and that means we can
use the Distributive Property here too.
a) 2x+8
     4  can be re-written as 14 (2x + 8). Then we can distribute the 41 :
                                        1            2x 8 x
                                          (2x + 8) =   + = +2
                                        4            4  4 2

b) 9y−2
     3 can be re-written as 3 (9y − 2), and then we can distribute the 3 :
                            1                                          1


                                        1            9y 2       2
                                          (9y − 2) =   − = 3y −
                                        3            3  3       3

c) Rewrite z+6   1                             1
            2 as 2 (z + 6), and distribute the 2 :

                                         1          z 6 z
                                           (z + 6) = + = + 3
                                         2          2 2 2

Solve Real-World Problems Using the Distributive Property
The Distributive Property is one of the most common mathematical properties used in everyday life. Any
time we have two or more groups of objects, the Distributive Property can help us solve for an unknown.

**Example 4**

Each student on a ﬁeld trip into a forest is to be given an emergency survival kit. The kit is to contain a
ﬂashlight, a ﬁrst aid kit, and emergency food rations. Flashlights cost $12 each, ﬁrst aid kits are $7 each
and emergency food rations cost $2 per day. There is $500 available for the kits and 17 students to provide
for. How many days worth of rations can be provided with each kit?
The unknown quantity in this problem is the number of days’ rations. This will be x in our expression.
Each kit will contain one $12 ﬂashlight, one $7 ﬁrst aid kit, and x times $2 worth of rations, for a total
cost of (12 + 7 + 2x) dollars. With 17 kits, therefore, the total cost will be 17(12 + 7 + 2x) dollars.
We can use the Distributive Property on this expression:

                                    17(12 + 7 + 2x) = 204 + 119 + 34x

Since the total cost can be at most $500, we set the expression equal to 500 and solve for x. (You’ll learn
in more detail how to solve equations like this in the next chapter.)

                                       204 + 119 + 34x = 500
                                             323 + 34x = 500
                                       323 + 34x − 323 = 500 − 323
                                                   34x = 177
                                                   34x    177
                                                       =
                                                   34      34
                                                     x ≈ 5.206

Since this represents the number of days’ worth of rations that can be bought, we must round to the
next lowest whole number. We wouldn’t have enough money to buy a sixth day of supplies.

**Solution:**

Five days worth of emergency rations can be purchased for each survival kit.

Find Square Roots
The square root of a number is a number which, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. In
other words, if a = b2 , we say that b is the square root of a.
Note: Negative numbers and positive numbers both yield positive numbers when squared, so each positive
number has both a positive and a negative square root. (For example, 3 and -3 can both be squared to
yield 9.) The positive square root of a number is called the principal square root.
                                            √                     √              √
The square root of a number x is written as x or sometimes as 2 x. The symbol       is sometimes called
a radical sign.
Numbers with whole-number square roots are called perfect squares. The ﬁrst ﬁve perfect squares (1, 4,
9, 16, and 25) are shown below.

You can determine whether a number is a perfect square by looking at its prime factors. If every number
in the factor tree appears an even number of times, the number is a perfect square. To ﬁnd the square
root of that number, simply take one of each pair of matching factors and multiply them together.

**Example 1**

Find the principal square root of each of these perfect squares.
a) 121
b) 225
c) 324
d) 576

**Solution:**

                       √
a) 121 = 11 × 11, so    121 = 11.
                                √
b) 225 = (5 × 5) × (3 × 3), so 225 = 5 × 3 = 15.
                                         √
c) 324 = (2 × 2) × (3 × 3) × (3 × 3), so 324 = 2 × 3 × 3 = 18.
                                                  √
d) 576 = (2 × 2) × (2 × 2) × (2 × 2) × (3 × 3), so 576 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 = 24.
For more practice matching numbers with their square roots, try the Flash games at http://www.quia.
com/jg/65631.html.
When the prime factors don’t pair up neatly, we√“factor out” the ones that do pair up and leave the rest
under a radical sign. We write the answer as a b, where a is the product of half the paired factors we
pulled out and b is the product of the leftover factors.

**Example 2**

Find the principal square root of the following numbers.
a) 8
b) 48
c) 75
d) 216

**Solution:**

                                                                      √     √
a) 8 = 2 × 2 × 2. This gives us one pair of 2’s and one leftover 2, so 8 = 2 2.
                                  √              √       √
b) 48 = (2 × 2) × (2 × 2) × 3, so 48 = 2 × 2 × 3, or 4 3.
                        √        √
c) 75 = (5 × 5) × 3, so 75 = 5 3.
                                      √               √            √
d) 216 = (2 × 2) × 2 × (3 × 3) × 3, so 216 = 2 × 3 × 2 × 3, or 6 6.
Note that in the last example we collected the paired factors ﬁrst, then we collected the unpaired ones
under a single radical symbol. Here are the four rules that govern how we treat square roots.


     √    √    √

b) 3 4 × 4 3 = 12 12 = 12 (2 × 2) × 3 = 12 × 2 3 = 24 3
   √      √    √      √
c) 12 ÷ 3 = 12   3 =     4=2
     √      √       √       √
d) 12 10 ÷ 6 5 = 12
                       5 =2 2


Approximate Square Roots
             √ √          √
Terms like 2, 3 and 7 (square roots of prime numbers) cannot be written as rational numbers.
That is to say, they cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. We call them irrational numbers.
In decimal form, they have an unending, seemingly random, string of numbers after the decimal point.
                                                            √      √
To ﬁnd approximate values for square roots, we use the          or x button on a calculator. When the
number we plug in is a perfect square, or the square of a rational number, we will get an exact answer.
When the number is a non-perfect square, the answer will be irrational and will look like a random string
of digits. Since the calculator can only show some of the inﬁnitely many digits that are actually in the
answer, it is really showing us an approximate answer—not exactly the right answer, but as close as it
can get.

**Example 4**

Use a calculator to ﬁnd the following square roots. Round your answer to three decimal places.
   √
a) 99
   √
b) 5
  √
c) 0.5
   √
d) 1.75

**Solution:**

a) ≈ 9.950
b) ≈ 2.236
c) ≈ 0.707
d) ≈ 1.323

You can also work out square roots by hand using a method similar to long division. (See the web page
at http://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/square-root-algorithm.php for an explanation of this
method.)


Identify Irrational Numbers
Not all square roots are irrational, but
                                       √ any square root that can’t be reduced √ to a form with no radical
signs in√it is irrational. For√example, 49 is rational because it equals 7, but 50 can’t be reduced farther
than 5 2. That factor of 2 is irrational, making the whole expression irrational.

**Example 5**

Identify which of the following are rational numbers and which are irrational numbers.
a) 23.7
b) 2.8956
c) π
    √
d) 6
e) 3.27

**Solution:**

a) 23.7 can be written as 23 10 , so it is rational.
b) 2.8956 can be written as 2 10000 , so it is rational.
c) π = 3.141592654 . . . We know from the deﬁnition of π that the decimals do not terminate or repeat, so
π is irrational.
    √      √     √
d) 6 = 2 × 3. We can’t reduce it to a form without radicals in it, so it is irrational.
e) 3.27 = 3.272727272727 . . . This decimal goes on forever, but it’s not random; it repeats in a predictable
pattern. Repeating decimals are always rational; this one can actually be expressed as 11    .
You can see from this example that any number whose decimal representation has a ﬁnite number of digits
is rational, since each decimal place can be expressed as a fraction. For example, 0.439 can be expressed as
 4     3      9            439
10 + 100 + 1000 , or just 1000 . Also, any decimal that repeats is rational, and can be expressed as a fraction.
                                              25    38
For example, 0.2538 can be expressed as 100      + 9900 , which is equivalent to 2513
                                                                                 9900 .


Classify Real Numbers
We can now see how real numbers fall into one of several categories.


If a real number can be expressed as a rational number, it falls into one of two categories. If the denominator

of its simplest form is one, then it is an integer. If not, it is a fraction (this term also includes decimals,
since they can be written as fractions.)
If the number cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers (i.e. as a fraction), it is irrational.

**Example 6**

Classify the following real numbers.
a) 0
b) -1
c) 3π
     √
d)    3
     √
e)    9

**Solution:**

a) Integer
b) Integer
c) Irrational (Although it’s written as a fraction, π is irrational, so any fraction with π in it is also irrational.)
d) Irrational
e) Rational (It simpliﬁes to 69 , or 23 .)


Lesson Summary
- The square root of a number is a number which gives the original number when multiplied by itself.
                                                                         √
       In algebraic terms, for two numbers a and b, if a = b2 , then b = a.
- A square root can have two possible values: a positive value called the principal square root, and
       a negative value (the opposite of the positive value).
- A perfect square is a number whose square root is an integer.
- Some mathematical properties of square roots are:
             √     √     √
          – a × b √= ab √
              √
          – A√ a ×√B b = AB ab
              a
          – √ = ab
              b
              √      √
             A a
          – √ = AB ab
             B b

- Square roots of numbers that are not perfect squares (or ratios of perfect squares) are irrational
       numbers. They cannot be written as rational numbers (the ratio of two integers). In decimal form,
       they have an unending, seemingly random, string of numbers after the decimal point.
- Computing a square root on a calculator will produce an approximate solution since the calculator
       only shows a ﬁnite number of digits after the decimal point.

## 2.6 Problem-Solving Strategies: Guess and Check,

    Work Backward

### Learning Objectives

- Read and understand given problem situations.
- Develop and use the strategy “Guess and Check.”
- Develop and use the strategy “Work Backward.”
- Plan and compare alternative approaches to solving problems.
- Solve real-world problems using selected strategies as part of a plan.

Introduction
In this section, you will learn about the methods of Guess and Check and Working Backwards. These
are very powerful strategies in problem solving and probably the most commonly used in everyday life.
Let’s review our problem-solving plan.
Step 1
Understand the problem.
Read the problem carefully. Then list all the components and data involved, and assign your variables.
Step 2
Devise a plan – Translate
Come up with a way to solve the problem. Set up an equation, draw a diagram, make a chart or construct
a table.
Step 3
Carry out the plan – Solve
This is where you solve the equation you came up with in Step 2.
Step 4
Look – Check and Interpret
Check that the answer makes sense.
Let’s now look at some strategies we can use as part of this plan.


Develop and Use the Strategy “Guess and Check”
The strategy for the method “Guess and Check” is to guess a solution and then plug the guess back into
the problem to see if you get the correct answer. If the answer is too big or too small, make another guess
that will get you closer to the goal, and continue guessing until you arrive at the correct solution. The
process might sound long, but often you will ﬁnd patterns that you can use to make better guesses along
the way.
Here is an example of how this strategy is used in practice.

**Example 1**

Nadia takes a ribbon that is 48 inches long and cuts it in two pieces. One piece is three times as long as
the other. How long is each piece?

**Solution:**

Step 1: Understand
We need to ﬁnd two numbers that add up to 48. One number is three times the other number.
Step 2: Strategy
We guess two random numbers, one three times bigger than the other, and ﬁnd the sum.
If the sum is too small we guess larger numbers, and if the sum is too large we guess smaller numbers.
Then, we see if any patterns develop from our guesses.
Step 3: Apply Strategy/Solve

                         Guess       5 and 15     5 + 15 = 20     sum is too small
                         Guess       6 and 18     6 + 18 = 24     sum is too small

Our second guess gives us a sum that is exactly half of 48. What if we double that guess?
                                                12 + 36 = 48

There’s our answer. The pieces are 12 and 36 inches long.
Step 4: Check
                    12 + 36 = 48          The pieces add up to 48 inches.
                         36 = 3(12)       One piece is three times as long as the other.

The answer checks out.


Develop and Use the Strategy “Work Backward”
The “Work Backward” method works well for problems where a series of operations is done on an unknown
number and you’re only given the result. To use this method, start with the result and apply the operations
in reverse order until you ﬁnd the starting number.

**Example 2**

Anne has a certain amount of money in her bank account on Friday morning. During the day she writes a
check for $24.50, makes an ATM withdrawal of $80 and deposits a check for $235. At the end of the day
she sees that her balance is $451.25. How much money did she have in the bank at the beginning of the
day?
Step 1: Understand
We need to ﬁnd the money in Anne’s bank account at the beginning of the day on Friday.
She took out $24.50 and $80 and put in $235.
She ended up with $451.25 at the end of the day.
Step 2: Strategy
We start with an unknown amount, do some operations, and end up with a known amount.
We need to start with the result and apply the operations in reverse.
Step 3: Apply Strategy/Solve
Start with $451.25. Subtract $235, add $80, and then add $24.50.
451.25 − 235 + 80 + 24.50 = 320.75
Anne had $320.75 in her account at the beginning of the day on Friday.
Step 4: Check
                       Anne starts with                    $320.75
                       She writes a check for $24.50.      $320.75 − 24.50 = $296.25
                       She withdraws $80.                  $296.25 − 80 = $216.25
                       She deposits $235.                  $216.25 + 235 = $451.25

The answer checks out.

Plan and Compare Alternative Approaches to Solving Problems
Most word problems can be solved in more than one way. Often one method is more straightforward than
others, but which method is best can depend on what kind of problem you are facing.

**Example 3**

Nadia’s father is 36. He is 16 years older than four times Nadia’s age. How old is Nadia?

**Solution:**

This problem can be solved with either of the strategies you learned in this section. Let’s solve it using
both strategies.
Guess and Check Method
Step 1: Understand
We need to ﬁnd Nadia’s age.
We know that her father is 16 years older than four times her age, or 4 × (Nadia’s age) + 16.
We know her father is 36 years old.
Step 2: Strategy
We guess a random number for Nadia’s age.
We multiply the number by 4 and add 16 and check to see if the result equals 36.
If the answer is too small, we guess a larger number, and if the answer is too big, we guess a smaller
number.
We keep guessing until we get the answer to be 36.
Step 3: Apply strategy/Solve

       Guess Nadia’s age                10        4(10) + 16 = 56      too big for her father’s age
       Guess a smaller number           9         4(9) + 16 = 52       still too big

Guessing 9 for Nadia’s age gave us a number that is 16 years too great to be her father’s age. But notice
that when we decreased Nadia’s age by one, her father’s age decreased by four. That suggests that we can
decrease our ﬁnal answer by 16 years if we decrease our guess by 4 years.
4 years less than 9 is 5. 4(5) + 16 = 36, which is the right age.
Answer: Nadia is 5 years old.
Step 4: Check
Nadia is 5 years old. Her father’s age is 4(5) + 16 = 36. This is correct. The answer checks out.
Work Backward Method
Step 1: Understand
We need to ﬁnd Nadia’s age.
We know her father is 16 years older than four times her age, or 4 × (Nadia’s age) + 16.
We know her father is 36 years old.
Step 2: Strategy
To get from Nadia’s age to her father’s age, we multiply Nadia’s age by four and add 16.
Working backwards means we start with the father’s age, subtract 16 and divide by 4.

Step 3: Apply Strategy/Solve

                               Start with the father’s age     36
                               Subtract 16                     36 − 16 = 20
                               Divide by 4                     20 ÷ 4 = 5

Answer Nadia is 5 years old.
Step 4: Check
Nadia is 5 years old. Her father’s age is 4(5) + 16 = 36. This is correct. The answer checks out.
You see that in this problem, the “Work Backward” strategy is more straightforward than the Guess and
Check method. The Work Backward method always works best when we know the result of a series of
operations, but not the starting number. In the next chapter, you will learn algebra methods based on the
Work Backward method.


Lesson Summary
The four steps of the problem solving plan are:

- Understand the problem
- Devise a plan – Translate
- Carry out the plan – Solve
- Look – Check and Interpret

Two common problem solving strategies are:
Guess and Check
Guess a solution and use the guess in the problem to see if you get the correct answer. If the answer is too
big or too small, then make another guess that will get you closer to the goal.
Work Backward
This method works well for problems in which a series of operations is applied to an unknown quantity
and you are given the resulting number. Start with the result and apply the operations in reverse order
until you ﬁnd the unknown.


### Review Questions

  1. Finish the problem we started in Example 1.
  2. Nadia is at home and Peter is at school which is 6 miles away from home. They start traveling towards
     each other at the same time. Nadia is walking at 3.5 miles per hour and Peter is skateboarding at 6

### Learning Objectives

- Solve an equation using addition.
- Solve an equation using subtraction.
- Solve an equation using multiplication.
- Solve an equation using division.


Introduction
Nadia is buying a new mp3 player. Peter watches her pay for the player with a $100 bill. She receives
$22.00 in change, and from only this information, Peter works out how much the player cost. How much
was the player?
In algebra, we can solve problems like this using an equation. An equation is an algebraic expression
that involves an equals sign. If we use the letter x to represent the cost of the mp3 player, we can write
the equation x + 22 = 100. This tells us that the value of the player plus the value of the change received
is equal to the $100 that Nadia paid.
Another way we could write the equation would be x = 100 − 22. This tells us that the value of the player
is equal to the total amount of money Nadia paid (100 − 22). This equation is mathematically equivalent
to the ﬁrst one, but it is easier to solve.
In this chapter, we will learn how to solve for the variable in a one-variable linear equation. Linear
equations are equations in which each term is either a constant, or a constant times a single variable
(raised to the ﬁrst power). The term linear comes from the word line, because the graph of a linear
equation is always a line.
We’ll start with simple problems like the one in the last example.


Solving Equations Using Addition and Subtraction
When we work with an algebraic equation, it’s important to remember that the two sides have to stay
equal for the equation to stay true. We can change the equation around however we want, but whatever

we do to one side of the equation, we have to do to the other side. In the introduction above, for example,
we could get from the ﬁrst equation to the second equation by subtracting 22 from both sides:

                                               x + 22 = 100
                                          x + 22 − 22 = 100 − 22
                                                     x = 100 − 22

Similarly, we can add numbers to each side of an equation to help solve for our unknown.

**Example 1**

Solve x − 3 = 9.

**Solution:**

To solve an equation for x, we need to isolate x−that is, we need to get it by itself on one side of the
equals sign. Right now our x has a 3 subtracted from it. To reverse this, we’ll add 3—but we must add 3
to both sides.

                                                 x−3=9
                                             x−3+3=9+3
                                                 x+0=9+3
                                                        x = 12


**Example 2**

Solve z − 9.7 = −1.026

**Solution:**

It doesn’t matter what the variable is—the solving process is the same.

                                             z − 9.7 = −1.026
                                        z − 9.7 + 9.7 = −1.026 + 9.7
                                                   z = 8.674

Make sure you understand the addition of decimals in this example!

**Example 3**

Solve x + 47 = 95 .

**Solution:**

To isolate x, we need to subtract 47 from both sides.

                                                4   9

                                                    5 7

Now we have to subtract fractions, which means we need to ﬁnd the LCD. Since 5 and 7 are both prime,
their lowest common multiple is just their product, 35.

them frequently.


Solving Equations Using Multiplication and Division


Suppose you are selling pizza for $1.50 a slice and you can get eight slices out of a single pizza. How much
money do you get for a single pizza? It shouldn’t take you long to ﬁgure out that you get 8×$1.50 = $12.00.
You solved this problem by multiplying. Here’s how to do the same thing algebraically, using x to stand
for the cost in dollars of the whole pizza.

**Example 4**

Solve 81 · x = 1.5.
Our x is being multiplied by one-eighth. To cancel that out and get x by itself, we have to multiply by the
reciprocal, 8. Don’t forget to multiply both sides of the equation.
                                              (1 )
                                             8 · x = 8(1.5)
                                                   x = 12


**Example 5**

Solve 9x
      5 = 5.

5 is equivalent to 5 · x, so to cancel out that 5 , we multiply by the reciprocal, 9 .
9x                 9                            9                                  5


                                                5 ( 9x ) 5
                                                        = (5)
                                                9 5      9
                                                      x=


**Example 6**

Solve 0.25x = 5.25.

0.25 is the decimal equivalent of one fourth, so to cancel out the 0.25 factor we would multiply by 4.

                                              4(0.25x) = 4(5.25)
                                                     x = 21

Solving by division is another way to isolate x. Suppose you buy ﬁve identical candy bars, and you are
charged $3.25. How much did each candy bar cost? You might just divide $3.25 by 5, but let’s see how
this problem looks in algebra.

**Example 7**

Solve 5x = 3.25.
To cancel the 5, we divide both sides by 5.
                                                  5x   3.25
                                                     =
                                                  5      5
                                                   x = 0.65


**Example 8**

Solve 7x = 11 .
Divide both sides by 7.
                                                  x=
                                                     11.7
                                                  x=


**Example 9**

Solve 1.375x = 1.2.
Divide by 1.375
                                                       1.2
                                                  x=
                                                      1.375
                                                  x = 0.872

Notice the bar above the ﬁnal two decimals; it means that those digits recur, or repeat. The full answer is
0.872727272727272....

Solve Real-World Problems Using Equations

**Example 10**

In the year 2017, Anne will be 45years old. In what year was Anne born?
The unknown here is the year Anne was born, so that’s our variable x. Here’s our equation:

                                                x + 45 = 2017
                                         x + 45 − 45 = 2017 − 45
                                                     x = 1972

Anne was born in 1972.

**Example 11**

A mail order electronics company stocks a new mini DVD player and is using a balance to determine
the shipping weight. Using only one-pound weights, the shipping department found that the following
arrangement balances:


How much does each DVD player weigh?

**Solution:**

Since the system balances, the total weight on each side must be equal. To write our equation, we’ll use x
for the weight of one DVD player, which is unknown. There are two DVD players, weighing a total of 2x
pounds, on the left side of the balance, and on the right side are 5 1-pound weights, weighing a total of 5
pounds. So our equation is 2x = 5. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 2.5.
Each DVD player weighs 2.5 pounds.

**Example 12**

In 2004, Takeru Kobayashi of Nagano, Japan, ate 53.5 hot dogs in 12 minutes. This was 3 more hot dogs
than his own previous world record, set in 2002. Calculate:
a) How many minutes it took him to eat one hot dog.
b) How many hot dogs he ate per minute.
c) What his old record was.

**Solution:**

a) We know that the total time for 53.5 hot dogs is 12 minutes. We want to know the time for one hot
dog, so that’s x. Our equation is 53.5x = 12. Then we divide both sides by 53.5 to get x = 53.5  , or
x = 0.224 minutes.
We can also multiply by 60 to get the time in seconds; 0.224 minutes is about 13.5 seconds. So that’s how
long it took Takeru to eat one hot dog.
b) Now we’re looking for hot dogs per minute instead of minutes per hot dog. We’ll use the variable y
instead of x this time so we don’t get the two confused. 12 minutes, times the number of hot dogs per
minute, equals the total number of hot dogs, so 12y = 53.5. Dividing both sides by 12 gives us y = 53.5
                                                                                                    12 , or
y = 4.458 hot dogs per minute.
c) We know that his new record is 53.5, and we know that’s three more than his old record. If we call his
old record z, we can write the following equation: z + 3 = 53.5. Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us
z = 50.5. So Takeru’s old record was 50.5 hot dogs in 12 minutes.


Lesson Summary
- An equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and a single variable
    is a linear equation.
- We can add, subtract, multiply, or divide both sides of an equation by the same value and still have
    an equivalent equation.

- To solve an equation, isolate the unknown variable on one side of the equation by applying one or
   more arithmetic operations to both sides.

Solve a Two-Step Equation
We’ve seen how to solve for an unknown by isolating it on one side of an equation and then evaluating the
other side. Now we’ll see how to solve equations where the variable takes more than one step to isolate.

**Example 1**

Rebecca has three bags containing the same number of marbles, plus two marbles left over. She places them
on one side of a balance. Chris, who has more marbles than Rebecca, adds marbles to the other side of the
balance. He ﬁnds that with 29 marbles, the scales balance. How many marbles are in each bag? Assume
the bags weigh nothing.


**Solution:**

We know that the system balances, so the weights on each side must be equal. If we use x to represent the
number of marbles in each bag, then we can see that on the left side of the scale we have three bags (each
containing x marbles) plus two extra marbles, and on the right side of the scale we have 29 marbles. The
balancing of the scales is similar to the balancing of the following equation.

                                                 3x + 2 = 29

“Three bags plus two marbles equals 29 marbles”
To solve for x, we need to ﬁrst get all the variables (terms containing an x) alone on one side of the equation.
We’ve already got all the x’s on one side; now we just need to isolate them.

               3x + 2 = 29
           3x + 2 − 2 = 29 − 2     Get rid of the 2 on the left by subtracting it from both sides.
                  3x = 27
                  3x   27
                     =             Divide both sides by 3.
                  3     3
                   x=9

There are nine marbles in each bag.
We can do the same with the real objects as we did with the equation. Just as we subtracted 2 from both
sides of the equals sign, we could remove two marbles from each side of the scale. Because we removed the
same number of marbles from each side, we know the scales will still balance.

Then, because there are three bags of marbles on the left-hand side of the scale, we can divide the marbles
on the right-hand side into three equal piles. You can see that there are nine marbles in each.
Three bags of marbles balances three piles of nine marbles.


So each bag of marbles balances nine marbles, meaning that each bag contains nine marbles.

**Example 2**

Solve 6(x + 4) = 12.
This equation has the x buried in parentheses. To dig it out, we can proceed in one of two ways: we
can either distribute the six on the left, or divide both sides by six to remove it from the left. Since the
right-hand side of the equation is a multiple of six, it makes sense to divide. That gives us x + 4 = 2. Then
we can subtract 4 from both sides to get x = −2.

**Example 3**

Solve x−3
       5 = 7.
It’s always a good idea to get rid of fractions ﬁrst. Multiplying both sides by 5 gives us x − 3 = 35, and
then we can add 3 to both sides to get x = 38.

**Example 4**

Solve 95 (x + 1) = 27 .
First, we’ll cancel the fraction on the left by multiplying by the reciprocal (the multiplicative inverse).
                                             9 5           9 2
                                              · (x + 1) = ·
                                             5 9           5 7
                                                 (x + 1) =

Then we subtract 1 from both sides. ( 35
                                      35 is equivalent to 1.)
                                                x+1=
                                                   18 35
                                            x+1−1=     −
                                                   35 35
                                                   18 − 35
                                                x=
                                                   −17
                                                x=

These examples are called two-step equations, because we need to perform two separate operations on
the equation to isolate the variable.


Solve a Two-Step Equation by Combining Like Terms
When we look at a linear equation we see two kinds of terms: those that contain the unknown variable,
and those that don’t. When we look at an equation that has an x on both sides, we know that in order to
solve it, we need to get all the x−terms on one side of the equation. This is called combining like terms.
The terms with an x in them are like terms because they contain the same variable (or, as you will see
in later chapters, the same combination of variables).

                                                Table 3.1:

 Like Terms                                            Unlike Terms

                      x
                                                       3x and 3y
 3y, 0.000001y, and y                                  4xy and 4x
 xy, 6xy, and 2.39xy                                   0.5x and 0.5


To add or subtract like terms, we can use the Distributive Property of Multiplication.

                                       3x + 4x = (3 + 4)x = 7x
                                0.03xy − 0.01xy = (0.03 − 0.01)xy = 0.02xy
                                 −y + 16y + 5y = (−1 + 16 + 5)y = 10y
                                   5z + 2z − 7z = (5 + 2 − 7)z = 0z = 0

To solve an equation with two or more like terms, we need to combine the terms ﬁrst.

**Example 5**

Solve (x + 5) − (2x − 3) = 6.
There are two like terms: the x and the −2x (don’t forget that the negative sign applies to everything in
the parentheses). So we need to get those terms together. The associative and distributive properties let
us rewrite the equation as x + 5 − 2x + 3 = 6, and then the commutative property lets us switch around
the terms to get x − 2x + 5 + 3 = 6, or (x − 2x) + (5 + 3) = 6.
(x − 2x) is the same as (1 − 2)x, or −x, so our equation becomes −x + 8 = 6
Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us −x = −2.
And ﬁnally, multiplying both sides by -1 gives us x = 2.

**Example 6**

Solve 2x − 3x = 6.
This problem requires us to deal with fractions. We need to write all the terms on the left over a common
denominator of six.
                                                3x 2x
                                                  −   =6
                                                6   6

Then we subtract the fractions to get 6x = 6.
Finally we multiply both sides by 6 to get x = 36.

Solve Real-World Problems Using Two-Step Equations
The hardest part of solving word problems is translating from words to an equation. First, you need to
look to see what the equation is asking. What is the unknown for which you have to solve? That will be
what your variable stands for. Then, follow what is going on with your variable all the way through the
problem.

**Example 7**


An emergency plumber charges $65 as a call-out fee plus an additional $75 per hour. He arrives at a house
at 9:30 and works to repair a water tank. If the total repair bill is $196.25, at what time was the repair
completed?
In order to solve this problem, we collect the information from the text and convert it to an equation.
Unknown: time taken in hours – this will be our x
The bill is made up of two parts: a call out fee and a per-hour fee. The call out is a ﬂat fee, and independent
of x—it’s the same no matter how many hours the plumber works. The per-hour part depends on the
number of hours (x). So the total fee is $65 (no matter what) plus $75x (where x is the number of hours),
or 65 + 75x.
Looking at the problem again, we also can see that the total bill is $196.25. So our ﬁnal equation is
196.25 = 65 + 75x.
Solving for x:

                            196.25 = 65 + 75x       Subtract 65 from both sides.
                            131.25 = 75x           Divide both sides by 75.
                               1.75 = x            The job took 1.75 hours.


**Solution:**

The repair job was completed 1.75 hours after 9:30, so it was completed at 11:15AM.

**Example 8**

When Asia was young her Daddy marked her height on the door frame every month. Asia’s Daddy noticed
that between the ages of one and three, he could predict her height (in inches) by taking her age in months,
adding 75 inches and multiplying the result by one-third. Use this information to answer the following:
a) Write an equation linking her predicted height, h, with her age in months, m.
b) Determine her predicted height on her second birthday.
c) Determine at what age she is predicted to reach three feet tall.

**Solution:**

a) To convert the text to an equation, ﬁrst determine the type of equation we have. We are going to have
an equation that links two variables. Our unknown will change, depending on the information we are

given. For example, we could solve for height given age, or solve for age given height. However, the text
gives us a way to determine height. Our equation will start with “h =”.
The text tells us that we can predict her height by taking her age in months, adding 75, and multiplying
by 31 . So our equation is h = (m + 75) · 31 , or h = 13 (m + 75).
b) To predict Asia’s height on her second birthday, we substitute m = 24 into our equation (because 2
years is 24 months) and solve for h.
                                             h = (24 + 75)
                                             h = (99)
                                             h = 33

Asia’s height on her second birthday was predicted to be 33 inches.
c) To determine the predicted age when she reached three feet, substitute h = 36 into the equation and
solve for m.
                                             36 = (m + 75)
                                            108 = m + 75
                                             33 = m

Asia was predicted to be 33 months old when her height was three feet.

**Example 9**

To convert temperatures in Fahrenheit to temperatures in Celsius, follow the following steps: Take the
temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and subtract 32. Then divide the result by 1.8 and this gives the
temperature in degrees Celsius.
a) Write an equation that shows the conversion process.
b) Convert 50 degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius.
c) Convert 25 degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit.
d) Convert -40 degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit.
a) The text gives the process to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. We can write an equation using two
variables. We will use f for temperature in Fahrenheit, and c for temperature in Celsius.

           First we take the temperature in Fahrenheit and subtract 32.            f − 32
                                                                                   f − 32
           Then divide by 1.8.
                                                                                     1.8
                                                                                        f − 32
           This equals the temperature in Celsius.                                 c=
                                                                                          1.8
In order to convert from one temperature scale to another, simply substitute in for whichever temperature
you know, and solve for the one you don’t know.
b) To convert 50 degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius, substitute f = 50 into the equation.
                                                   50 − 32
                                               c=
                                                      1.8
                                               c=
                                                   1.8
                                               c = 10

50 degrees Fahrenheit is equal to 10 degrees Celsius.
c) To convert 25 degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit, substitute c = 25 into the equation:

                                                     f − 32
                                                25 =
                                                       1.8
                                                45 = f − 32
                                                77 = f

25 degrees Celsius is equal to 77 degrees Fahrenheit.
d) To convert -40 degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit, substitute c = −40 into the equation.

                                                      f − 32
                                                −40 =
                                                        1.8
                                                −72 = f − 32
                                                −40 = f

-40 degrees Celsius is equal to -40 degrees Fahrenheit. (No, that’s not a mistake! This is the one temperature
where they are equal.)


Lesson Summary
- Some equations require more than one operation to solve. Generally it, is good to go from the outside
    in. If there are parentheses around an expression with a variable in it, cancel what is outside the
    parentheses ﬁrst.
- Terms with the same variable in them (or no variable in them) are like terms. Combine like
    terms (adding or subtracting them from each other) to simplify the expression and solve for the
    unknown.

## 3.3 Multi-Step Equations


### Learning Objectives

- Solve a multi-step equation by combining like terms.
- Solve a multi-step equation using the distributive property.
- Solve real-world problems using multi-step equations.


Solving Multi-Step Equations by Combining Like Terms
We’ve seen that when we solve for an unknown variable, it can take just one or two steps to get the terms
in the right places. Now we’ll look at solving equations that take several steps to isolate the unknown
variable. Such equations are referred to as multi-step equations.
In this section, we’ll simply be combining the steps we already know how to do. Our goal is to end up
with all the constants on one side of the equation and all the variables on the other side. We’ll do this by
collecting like terms. Don’t forget, like terms have the same combination of variables in them.

**Example 1**


        3 − 5x = 6.
Solve 3x+4
Before we can combine the variable terms, we need to get rid of that fraction.

                                                                                3 − 3 = 6.
First let’s put all the terms on the left over a common denominator of three: 3x+4 15x

Combining the fractions then gives us 3x+4−15x
                                         3     = 6.
Combining like terms in the numerator gives us 4−12x
                                                 3   = 6.
Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us 4 − 12x = 18.
Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us −12x = 14.

And ﬁnally, dividing both sides by -12 gives us x = − 14
                                                      12 , which reduces to x = − 6 .


Solving Multi-Step Equations Using the Distributive Property

You may have noticed that when one side of the equation is multiplied by a constant term, we can either
distribute it or just divide it out. If we can divide it out without getting awkward fractions as a result,
then that’s usually the better choice, because it gives us smaller numbers to work with. But if dividing
would result in messy fractions, then it’s usually better to distribute the constant and go from there.

**Example 2**

Solve 7(2x − 5) = 21.
The ﬁrst thing we want to do here is get rid of the parentheses. We could use the Distributive Property,
but it just so happens that 7 divides evenly into 21. That suggests that dividing both sides by 7 is the
easiest way to solve this problem.
If we do that, we get 2x − 5 = 21
                                7 or just 2x − 5 = 3. Then all we need to do is add 5 to both sides to get
2x = 8, and then divide by 2 to get x = 4.

**Example 3**

Solve 17(3x + 4) = 7.
Once again, we want to get rid of those parentheses. We could divide both sides by 17, but that would
give us an inconvenient fraction on the right-hand side. In this case, distributing is the easier way to go.
Distributing the 17 gives us 51x + 68 = 7. Then we subtract 68 from both sides to get 51x = −61, and
then we divide by 51 to get x = −61
                                 51 . (Yes, that’s a messy fraction too, but since it’s our ﬁnal answer and
we don’t have to do anything else with it, we don’t really care how messy it is.)

**Example 4**

Solve 4(3x − 4) − 7(2x + 3) = 3.
Before we can collect like terms, we need to get rid of the parentheses using the Distributive Property.
That gives us 12x − 16 − 14x − 21 = 3, which we can rewrite as (12x − 14x) + (−16 − 21) = 3. This in turn
simpliﬁes to −2x − 37 = 3.
Next we add 37 to both sides to get −2x = 40.
And ﬁnally, we divide both sides by -2 to get x = −20.

**Example 5**

                                                      (      )
Solve the following equation for x: 0.1(3.2 + 2x) + 12 3 − 5x = 0
This function contains both fractions and decimals. We should convert all terms to one or the other.
It’s often easier to convert decimals to fractions, but in this equation the fractions are easy to convert to
decimals—and with decimals we don’t need to ﬁnd a common denominator!
In decimal form, our equation becomes 0.1(3.2 + 2x) + 0.5(3 − 0.2x) = 0.
Distributing to get rid of the parentheses, we get 0.32 + 0.2x + 1.5 − 0.1x = 0.
Collecting and combining like terms gives us 0.1x + 1.82 = 0.
Then we can subtract 1.82 from both sides to get 0.1x = −1.82, and ﬁnally divide by 0.1 (or multiply by
10) to get x = −18.2.

Solving Real-World Problems Using Multi-Step Equations

**Example 6**

A growers’ cooperative has a farmer’s market in the town center every Saturday. They sell what they have
grown and split the money into several categories. 8.5% of all the money taken in is set aside for sales
tax. $150 goes to pay the rent on the space they occupy. What remains is split evenly between the seven
growers. How much total money is taken in if each grower receives a $175 share?
Let’s translate the text above into an equation. The unknown is going to be the total money taken in
dollars. We’ll call this x.
“8.5% of all the money taken in is set aside for sales tax.” This means that 91.5% of the money remains.
This is 0.915x.
“$150 goes to pay the rent on the space they occupy.” This means that what’s left is 0.915x − 150.
“What remains is split evenly between the 7 growers.” That means each grower gets 0.915x−150
                                                                                       7     .
If each grower’s share is $175, then our equation to ﬁnd x is 0.915x−150
                                                                   7     = 175.
First we multiply both sides by 7 to get 0.915x − 150 = 1225.
Then add 150 to both sides to get 0.915x = 1375.
Finally divide by 0.915 to get x ≈ 1502.7322. Since we want our answer in dollars and cents, we round to
two decimal places, or $1502.73.
The workers take in a total of $1502.73.

**Example 7**

A factory manager is packing engine components into wooden crates to be shipped on a small truck. The
truck is designed to hold sixteen crates, and will safely carry a 1200 lb cargo. Each crate weighs 12 lbs
empty. How much weight should the manager instruct the workers to put in each crate in order to get the
shipment weight as close as possible to 1200 lbs?
The unknown quantity is the weight to put in each box, so we’ll call that x.
Each crate when full will weigh x + 12 lbs, so all 16 crates together will weigh 16(x + 12) lbs.
We also know that all 16 crates together should weigh 1200 lbs, so we can say that 16(x + 12) = 1200.
To solve this equation, we can start by dividing both sides by 16: x + 12 = 1200
                                                                             16 = 75.
Then subtract 12 from both sides: x = 63.
The manager should tell the workers to put 63 lbs of components in each crate.


Ohm’s Law
The electrical current, I (amps), passing through an electronic component varies directly with the applied
voltage, V (volts), according to the relationship V = I · R where R is the resistance measured in Ohms (Ω).

**Example 8**

A scientist is trying to deduce the resistance of an unknown component. He labels the resistance of the
unknown component x Ω. The resistance of a circuit containing a number of these components is (5x+20)Ω.
If a 120 volt potential diﬀerence across the circuit produces a current of 2.5 amps, calculate the resistance
of the unknown component.

**Solution:**


To solve this, we need to start with the equation V = I · R and substitute in V = 120, I = 2.5, and
R = 5x + 20. That gives us 120 = 2.5(5x + 20).
Distribute the 2.5 to get 120 = 12.5x + 50.
Subtract 50 from both sides to get 70 = 12.5x.
Finally, divide by 12.5 to get 5.6 = x.
The unknown components have a resistance of 5.6 Ω.


Distance, Speed and Time
The speed of a body is the distance it travels per unit of time. That means that we can also ﬁnd out how
far an object moves in a certain amount of time if we know its speed: we use the equation “distance =
speed × time.”

**Example 8**

Shanice’s car is traveling 10 miles per hour slower than twice the speed of Brandon’s car. She covers 93
miles in 1 hour 30 minutes. How fast is Brandon driving?

**Solution:**

Here, we don’t know either Brandon’s speed or Shanice’s, but since the question asks for Brandon’s speed,
that’s what we’ll use as our variable x.
The distance Shanice covers in miles is 93, and the time in hours is 1.5. Her speed is 10 less than
twice Brandon’s speed, or 2x − 10 miles per hour. Putting those numbers into the equation gives us
93 = 1.5(2x − 10).
First we distribute, to get 93 = 3x − 15.
Then we add 15 to both sides to get 108 = 3x.
Finally we divide by 3 to get 36 = x.
Brandon is driving at 36 miles per hour.
We can check this answer by considering the situation another way: we can solve for Shanice’s speed
instead of Brandon’s and then check that against Brandon’s speed. We’ll use y for Shanice’s speed since
we already used x for Brandon’s.
The equation for Shanice’s speed is simply 93 = 1.5y. We can divide both sides by 1.5 to get 62 = y, so
Shanice is traveling at 62 miles per hour.
The problem tells us that Shanice is traveling 10 mph slower than twice Brandon’s speed; that would mean
that 62 is equal to 2 times 36 minus 10. Is that true? Well, 2 times 36 is 72, minus 10 is 62. The answer
checks out.
In algebra, there’s almost always more than one method of solving a problem. If time allows, it’s always
a good idea to try to solve the problem using two diﬀerent methods just to conﬁrm that you’ve got the
answer right.


Speed of Sound
The speed of sound in dry air, v, is given by the equation v = 331 + 0.6T , where T is the temperature in
Celsius and v is the speed of sound in meters per second.

**Example 9**


Tashi hits a drainpipe with a hammer and 250 meters away Minh hears the sound and hits his own drainpipe.
Unfortunately, there is a one second delay between him hearing the sound and hitting his own pipe. Tashi
accurately measures the time between her hitting the pipe and hearing Mihn’s pipe at 2.46 seconds. What
is the temperature of the air?
This is a complex problem and we need to be careful in writing our equations. First of all, the distance
the sound travels is equal to the speed of sound multiplied by the time, and the speed is given by the
equation above. So the distance equals (331 + 0.6T ) × time, and the time is 2.46 − 1 (because for 1
second out of the 2.46 seconds measured, there was no sound actually traveling). We also know that the
distance is 250 × 2 (because the sound traveled from Tashi to Minh and back again), so our equation is
250 × 2 = (331 + 0.6T )(2.46 − 1), which simpliﬁes to 500 = 1.46(331 + 0.6T ).
Distributing gives us 500 = 483.26+0.876T , and subtracting 483.26 from both sides gives us 16.74 = 0.876T .
Then we divide by 0.876 to get T ≈ 19.1.
The temperature is about 19.1 degrees Celsius.


Lesson Summary
- Multi-step equations are slightly more complex than one - and two-step equations, but use the same
    basic techniques.
- If dividing a number outside of parentheses will produce fractions, it is often better to use the
    Distributive Property to expand the terms and then combine like terms to solve the equation.

## 3.4 Equations with Variables on Both Sides


### Learning Objectives

- Solve an equation with variables on both sides.
- Solve an equation with grouping symbols.
- Solve real-world problems using equations with variables on both sides.


Solve an Equation with Variables on Both Sides
When a variable appears on both sides of the equation, we need to manipulate the equation so that all
variable terms appear on one side, and only constants are left on the other.

**Example 1**

Dwayne was told by his chemistry teacher to measure the weight of an empty beaker using a balance.
Dwayne found only one lb weights, and so devised the following way of balancing the scales.


Knowing that each weight is one lb, calculate the weight of one beaker.

**Solution:**

We know that the system balances, so the weights on each side must be equal. We can write an algebraic
expression based on this fact. The unknown quantity, the weight of the beaker, will be our x. We can see
that on the left hand scale we have one beaker and four weights. On the right scale, we have four beakers
and three weights. The balancing of the scales is analogous to the balancing of the following equation:

                                              x + 4 = 4x + 3

“One beaker plus 4 lbs equals 4 beakers plus 3 lbs”
To solve for the weight of the beaker, we want all the constants (numbers) on one side and all the variables

(terms with x in them) on the other side. Since there are more beakers on the right and more weights on
the left, we’ll try to move all the x terms (beakers) to the right, and the constants (weights) to the left.
First we subtract 3 from both sides to get x + 1 = 4x.
Then we subtract x from both sides to get 1 = 3x.
Finally we divide by 3 to get 31 = x.
The weight of the beaker is one-third of a pound.
We can do the same with the real objects as we did with the equation. Just as we subtracted amounts
from each side of the equation, we could remove a certain number of weights or beakers from each scale.
Because we remove the same number of objects from each side, we know the scales will still balance.
First, we could remove three weights from each scale. This would leave one beaker and one weight on the
left and four beakers on the right (in other words x + 1 = 4x ):


Then we could remove one beaker from each scale, leaving only one weight on the left and three beakers
on the right, to get 1 = 3x:


Looking at the balance, it is clear that the weight of one beaker is one-third of a pound.

**Example 2**

Sven was told to ﬁnd the weight of an empty box with a balance. Sven found some one lb weights and ﬁve lb
weights. He placed two one lb weights in three of the boxes and with a fourth empty box found the following
way of balancing the scales:


Knowing that small weights are one lb and big weights are ﬁve lbs, calculate the weight of one box.
We know that the system balances, so the weights on each side must be equal. We can write an algebraic
expression based on this equality. The unknown quantity—the weight of each empty box, in pounds—will
be our x. A box with two 1 lb weights in it weighs (x + 2) pounds. Our equation, based on the picture, is
3(x + 2) = x + 3(5).
Distributing the 3 and simplifying, we get 3x + 6 = x + 15.

Subtracting x from both sides, we get 2x + 6 = 15.
Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get 2x = 9.
And ﬁnally we can divide by 2 to get x = 92 , or x = 4.5.
Each box weighs 4.5 lbs.
To see more examples of solving equations with variables on both sides of the equation, see the Khan
Academy video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn-GbH2S0Dk.


Solve an Equation with Grouping Symbols
As you’ve seen, we can solve equations with variables on both sides even when some of the variables are
in parentheses; we just have to get rid of the parentheses, and then we can start combining like terms. We
use the same technique when dealing with fractions: ﬁrst we multiply to get rid of the fractions, and then
we can shuﬄe the terms around by adding and subtracting.

**Example 3**

Solve 3x + 2 = 5x
               3.

**Solution:**

The ﬁrst thing we’ll do is get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides by 3, leaving
3(3x + 2) = 5x.
Then we distribute to get rid of the parentheses, leaving 9x + 6 = 5x.
We’ve already got all the constants on the left side, so we’ll move the variables to the right side by
subtracting 9x from both sides. That leaves us with 6 = −4x.
And ﬁnally, we divide by -4 to get − 23 = x, or x = −1.5.

**Example 4**

Solve 7x + 2 = 5x−3
                 6 .

**Solution:**

Again we start by eliminating the fraction. Multiplying both sides by 6 gives us 6(7x + 2) = 5x − 3, and
distributing gives us 42x + 12 = 5x − 3.
Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us 37x + 12 = −3.
Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 37x = −15.
Finally, dividing by 37 gives us x = − 15
                                       37 .

**Example 5**

                                     14x
Solve the following equation for x: (x+3) =7

**Solution:**

The form of the left hand side of this equation is known as a rational function because it is the ratio of
two other functions: 14x and (x + 3). But we can solve it just like any other equation involving fractions.
First we multiply both sides by (x + 3) to get rid of the fraction. Now our equation is 14x = 7(x + 3).
Then we distribute: 14x = 7x + 21.
Then subtract 7x from both sides: 7x = 21.
And divide by 7: x = 3.

Solve Real-World Problems Using Equations with Variables on
Both Sides
Here’s another chance to practice translating problems from words to equations. What is the equation
asking? What is the unknown variable? What quantity will we use for our variable?
The text explains what’s happening. Break it down into small, manageable chunks, and follow what’s
going on with our variable all the way through the problem.
More on Ohm’s Law
Recall that the electrical current, I (amps), passing through an electronic component varies directly with
the applied voltage, V (volts), according to the relationship V = I · R where R is the resistance measured
in Ohms (Ω).
The resistance R of a number of components wired in a series (one after the other) is simply the sum of
all the resistances of the individual components.

**Example 6**

In an attempt to ﬁnd the resistance of a new component, a scientist tests it in series with standard resistors.
A ﬁxed voltage causes a 4.8 amp current in a circuit made up from the new component plus a 15Ω resistor
in series. When the component is placed in a series circuit with a 50Ω resistor, the same voltage causes a
2.0 amp current to ﬂow. Calculate the resistance of the new component.
This is a complex problem to translate, but once we convert the information into equations it’s relatively
straightforward to solve. First, we are trying to ﬁnd the resistance of the new component (in Ohms, Ω).
This is our x. We don’t know the voltage that is being used, but we can leave that as a variable, V. Our
ﬁrst situation has a total resistance that equals the unknown resistance plus 15Ω. The current is 4.8 amps.
Substituting into the formula V = I · R, we get V = 4.8(x + 15).
Our second situation has a total resistance that equals the unknown resistance plus 50Ω. The current is
2.0 amps. Substituting into the same equation, this time we get V = 2(x + 50).
We know the voltage is ﬁxed, so the V in the ﬁrst equation must equal the V in the second. That means
we can set the right-hand sides of the two equations equal to each other: 4.8(x + 15) = 2(x + 50). Then we
can solve for x.
Distribute the constants ﬁrst: 4.8x + 72 = 2x + 100.
Subtract 2x from both sides: 2.8x + 72 = 100.
Subtract 72 from both sides: 2.8x = 28.
Divide by 2.8: x = 10.
The resistance of the component is 10Ω.


Lesson Summary
If an unknown variable appears on both sides of an equation, distribute as necessary. Then simplify the
equation to have the unknown on only one side.

Introduction
Nadia is counting out money with her little brother. She gives her brother all the nickels and pennies. She
keeps the quarters and dimes for herself. Nadia has four quarters and six dimes. Her brother has ﬁfteen
nickels and ﬁve pennies and is happy because he has more coins than his big sister. How would you explain
to him that he is actually getting a bad deal?


Write a ratio
A ratio is a way to compare two numbers, measurements or quantities. When we write a ratio, we divide
one number by another and express the answer as a fraction. There are two distinct ratios in the problem
                                                                                 4+6
above. For example, the ratio of the number of Nadia’s coins to her brother’s is 15+5 , or 10   1
                                                                                           20 = 2 . (Ratios
should always be simpliﬁed.) In other words, Nadia has half as many coins as her brother.
Another ratio we could look at is the value of the coins. The value of Nadia’s coins is (4 × 25) + (6 × 10) =
160 cents. The value of her brother’s coins is (15 × 5) + (5 × 1) = 80 cents. The ratio of the value of Nadia’s
coins to her brother’s is 160   2
                           80 = 1 . So the value of Nadia’s money is twice the value of her brother’s.
Notice that even though the denominator is one, we still write it out and leave the ratio as a fraction
instead of a whole number. A ratio with a denominator of one is called a unit rate.

**Example 1**

The price of a Harry Potter Book on Amazon.com is $10.00. The same book is also available used for
$6.50. Find two ways to compare these prices.

**Solution:**

We could compare the numbers by expressing the diﬀerence between them: $10.00 − $6.50 = $3.50.
We can also use a ratio to compare them: 10.00   100  20
                                          6.50 = 65 = 13 (after multiplying by 10 to remove the decimals,
and then simplifying).
So we can say that the new book is $3.50 more than the used book, or we can say that the new
book costs 20
            13 times as much as the used book.

**Example 2**

A tournament size shuﬄeboard table measures 30 inches wide by 14 feet long. Compare the length of the
table to its width and express the answer as a ratio.

**Solution:**

We could just write the ratio as 3014inches
                                       f eet
                                             . But since we’re comparing two lengths, it makes more sense
to convert all the measurements to the same units. 14 feet is 14 × 12 = 168 inches, so our new ratio is
168   28
 30 = 5 .

**Example 3**

A family car is being tested for fuel eﬀiciency. It drives non-stop for 100 miles and uses 3.2 gallons of
gasoline. Write the ratio of distance traveled to fuel used as a unit rate.

**Solution:**

                                  100 miles
The ratio of distance to fuel is 3.2 gallons . But a unit rate has to have a denominator of one, so to make

                                                                                      3.2 miles
this ratio a unit rate we need to divide both numerator and denominator by 3.2.      3.2           = 31.25 miles
                                                                                                      1 gallon or
                                                                                     3.2 gallons
31.25 miles per gallon.


Write and Solve a Proportion
When two ratios are equal to each other, we call it a proportion. For example, the equation 10   6
                                                                                             5 = 9 is a
proportion. We know it’s true because we can reduce both fractions to 23 .
(Check this yourself to make sure!)
We often use proportions in science and business—for example, when scaling up the size of something. We
generally use them to solve for an unknown, so we use algebra and label the unknown variable x.

**Example 4**

A small fast food chain operates 60 stores and makes $1.2 million proﬁt every year. How much proﬁt would
the chain make if it operated 250 stores?

**Solution:**

First, we need to write a ratio: the ratio of proﬁt to number of stores. That would be $1,200,000
                                                                                           60     .
Now we want to know how much proﬁt 250 stores would make. If we label that proﬁt x, then the ratio of
                                 x
proﬁt to stores in that case is 250 .
Since we’re assuming the proﬁt is proportional to the number of stores, the ratios are equal and our
proportion is 1,200,000
                           x
                        = 250 .
(Note that we can drop the units – not because they are the same in the numerator and denominator, but
because they are the same on both sides of the equation.)
                                                                                  x
To solve this equation, ﬁrst we simplify the left-hand fraction to get 20, 000 = 250 . Then we multiply both
sides by 250 to get 5, 000, 000 = x.
If the chain operated 250 stores, the annual proﬁt would be 5 million dollars.

**Example 5**

A chemical company makes up batches of copper sulfate solution by adding 250 kg of copper sulfate powder
to 1000 liters of water. A laboratory chemist wants to make a solution of identical concentration, but only
needs 350 mL (0.35 liters) of solution. How much copper sulfate powder should the chemist add to the
water?

**Solution:**

The ratio of powder to water in the ﬁrst case, in kilograms per liter, is 1000 , which reduces to 14 . In the
                                                                                                          x
second case, the unknown amount is how much powder to add. If we label that amount x, the ratio is 0.35     .
                     1     x
So our proportion is 4 = 0.35 .
To solve for x, ﬁrst we multiply both sides by 0.35 to get 0.35
                                                            4 = x, or x = 0.0875.
The mass of copper sulfate that the chemist should add is 0.0875 kg, or 87.5 grams.


Solve Proportions Using Cross Products
One neat way to simplify proportions is to cross multiply. Consider the following proportion:

                                                  16   20
                                                     =
                                                   4   5

If we want to eliminate the fractions, we could multiply both sides by 4 and then multiply both sides by
5. But suppose we just do both at once?
                                                     16          20
                                            4×5×        =4×5×
                                                      4          5
                                                 5 × 16 = 4 × 20

Now comparing this to the proportion we started with, we see that the denominator from the left hand side
ends up being multiplied by the numerator on the right hand side. You can also see that the denominator
from the right hand side ends up multiplying the numerator on the left hand side.
In eﬀect the two denominators have multiplied across the equal sign:


becomes 5 × 16 = 4 × 20.
This movement of denominators is known as cross multiplying. It is extremely useful in solving propor-
tions, especially when the unknown variable is in the denominator.

**Example 6**

Solve this proportion for x: 34 = 9x

**Solution:**

Cross multiply to get 4x = 9 × 3, or 4x = 27. Then divide both sides by 4 to get x = 27
                                                                                      4 , or x = 6.75.

**Example 7**

Solve the following proportion for x: 0.5  56
                                       3 = x

**Solution:**

Cross multiply to get 0.5x = 56 × 3, or 0.5x = 168. Then divide both sides by 0.5 to get x = 336.


Solve Real-World Problems Using Proportions

**Example 8**

A cross-country train travels at a steady speed. It covers 15 miles in 20 minutes. How far will it travel in
7 hours assuming it continues at the same speed?

**Solution:**

We’ve done speed problems before; remember that speed is just the ratio distance time , so that ratio is the one
we’ll use for our proportion. We can see that the speed is 2015minutes
                                                                miles
                                                                       , and that speed is also equal to 7x hours
                                                                                                            miles
                                                                                                                  .
To set up a proportion, we ﬁrst have to get the units the same. 20 minutes is 13 of an hour, so our proportion
will be 15    x
          1 = 7 . This is a very awkward looking ratio, but since we’ll be cross multiplying, we can leave it
as it is.
Cross multiplying gives us 7 × 15 = 31 x. Multiplying both sides by 3 then gives us 3 × 7 × 15 = x, or x = 315.
The train will travel 315 miles in 7 hours.

**Example 9**

In the United Kingdom, Alzheimer’s disease is said to aﬀect one in ﬁfty people over 65 years of age. If
approximately 250000 people over 65 are aﬀected in the UK, how many people over 65 are there in total?

**Solution:**


The ﬁxed ratio in this case is the 1 person in 50. The unknown quantity x is the total number of people over
65. Note that in this case we don’t need to include the units, as they will cancel between the numerator
and denominator.
                  1                                 people with Alzheimer’s
Our proportion is 50 = 250000
                          x . Each ratio represents       total people      .
Cross multiplying, we get 1 · x = 250000 · 50, or x = 12, 500, 000.
There are approximately 12.5 million people over the age of 65 in the UK.

Scale and Indirect Measurement
One place where ratios are often used is in making maps. The scale of a map describes the relationship
between distances on a map and the corresponding distances on the earth’s surface. These measurements
are expressed as a fraction or a ratio.
So far we have only written ratios as fractions, but outside of mathematics books, ratios are often written
as two numbers separated by a colon (:). For example, instead of 23 , we would write 2:3.
Ratios written this way are used to express the relationship between a map and the area it represents.
For example, a map with a scale of 1:1000 would be a map where one unit of measurement (such as a
centimeter) on the map would represent 1000 of the same unit (1000 centimeters, or 10 meters) in real life.

**Example 10**

Anne is visiting a friend in London, and is using the map below to navigate from Fleet Street to Borough
Road. She is using a 1:100,000 scale map, where 1 cm on the map represents 1 km in real life. Using a
ruler, she measures the distance on the map as 8.8 cm. How far is the real distance from the start of her
journey to the end?


**Solution:**

The scale is the ratio of distance on the map to the corresponding distance in real life. Written as a
fraction, it is 100000 . We can also write an equivalent ratio for the distance Anne measures on the map
and the distance in real life that she is trying to ﬁnd: 8.8x . Setting these two ratios equal gives us our
                1        8.8
proportion: 100000 = x . Then we can cross multiply to get x = 880000.
That’s how many centimeters it is from Fleet Street to Borough Road; now we need to convert to kilometers.
There are 100000 cm in a km, so we have to divide our answer by 100000.
                                                       = 8.8.

The distance from Fleet Street to Borough Road is 8.8 km.

In this problem, we could have just used our intuition: the 1 cm = 1 km scale tells us that any number of
cm on the map is equal to the same number of km in real life. But not all maps have a scale this simple.
You’ll usually need to refer to the map scale to convert between measurements on the map and distances
in real life!

**Example 11**

Antonio is drawing a map of his school for a project in math. He has drawn out the following map of the
school buildings and the surrounding area


He is trying to determine the scale of his ﬁgure. He knows that the distance from the point marked A
on the baseball diamond to the point marked B on the athletics track is 183 meters. Use the dimensions
marked on the drawing to determine the scale of his map.

**Solution:**

                                                                          distance on map
We know that the real-life distance is 183 m, and the scale is the ratio distance in real life .
To ﬁnd the distance on the map, we use Pythagoras’ Theorem: a2 + b2 = c2 , where a and b are the
horizontal and vertical lengths and c is the diagonal between points A and B.

                                                   82 + 142 = c2
                                                  64 + 196 = c2
                                                          260 = c2
                                                      √
                                                          260 = c
                                                      16.12 ≈ c

So the distance on the map is about 16.12 cm. The distance in real life is 183 m, which is 18300 cm. Now
we can divide:
                                                      16.12    1
                                            Scale =         ≈
                                                      18300 1135.23

The scale of Antonio’s map is approximately 1:1100.
Another visual use of ratio and proportion is in scale drawings. Scale drawings (often called plans) are
used extensively by architects. The equations governing scale are the same as for maps; the scale of a
drawing is the ratio distance on diagram
                     distance in real life .

**Example 12**

Oscar is trying to make a scale drawing of the Titanic, which he knows was 883 ft long. He would like his
drawing to be at a 1:500 scale. How many inches long does his sheet of paper need to be?

**Solution:**


We can reason intuitively that since the scale is 1:500, the paper must be 883
                                                                           500 = 1.766 f eet long. Converting
to inches means the length is 12(1.766) = 21.192 inches.
Oscar’s paper should be at least 22 inches long.

**Example 13**

The Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California measures 880 feet from north to south and 695 feet from
east to west. A scale diagram of the stadium is to be made. If 1 inch represents 100 feet, what would be
the dimensions of the stadium drawn on a sheet of paper? Will it ﬁt on a standard 8.5 × 11 inch sheet of
paper?

**Solution:**

Instead of using a proportion, we can simply use the following equation: (distance on diagram) = (distance
in real life) × (scale). (We can derive this from the fact that scale = distance on diagram
                                                                        distance in real life .)
Plugging in, we get
height on paper = 880 f eet × 100
                               1 inch
                                   f eet = 8.8 inches

width on paper = 695 f eet × 100
                              1 inch
                                  f eet = 6.95 inches
The scale diagram will be 8.8 in × 6.95 in. It will ﬁt on a standard sheet of paper.


Lesson Summary
- A ratio is a way to compare two numbers, measurements or quantities by dividing one number by
     the other and expressing the answer as a fraction.
- A proportion is formed when two ratios are set equal to each other.
- Cross multiplication is useful for solving equations in the form of proportions. To cross multiply,
     multiply the bottom of each ratio by the top of the other ratio and set them equal. For instance,
     cross multiplying
             results in 11 × 3 = 5x.

- Scale is a proportion that relates map distance to real life distance.

Introduction
A percent is simply a ratio with a base unit of 100. When we write a ratio as a fraction, the percentage
we want to represent is the numerator, and the denominator is 100. For example, 43% is another way of
         43    43                                   4.3
writing 100 . 1000 , on the other hand, is equal to 100 , so it would be equivalent to 4.3%. 25 is equal to 100
                                                                                                                ,
or 40%. To convert any fraction to a percent, just convert it to an equivalent fraction with a denominator
of 100, and then take the numerator as your percent value.
To convert a percent to a decimal, just move the decimal point two spaces to the right:

                                                  67% = 0.67
                                                 0.2% = 0.002
                                                 150% = 1.5

And to convert a decimal to a percent, just move the decimal point two spaces to the left:

                                                  2.3 = 230%
                                                 0.97 = 97%
                                             0.00002 = 0.002%


Finding and Converting Percentages
Before we work with percentages, we need to know how to convert between percentages, decimals and
fractions.
Converting percentages to fractions is the easiest. The word “percent” simply means “per 100”—so, for
                                    55                                          11
example, 55% means 55 per 100, or 100  . This fraction can then be simpliﬁed to 20 .

**Example 1**

Convert 32.5% to a fraction.

**Solution:**

32.5% is equal to 32.5 per 100, or 32.5                                                          10
                                   100 . To reduce this fraction, we ﬁrst need to multiply it by 10 to get rid
                       325                   13
of the decimal point. 1000 then reduces to 40 .
Converting fractions to percentages can be a little harder. To convert a fraction directly to a percentage,
you need to express it as an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 100.

**Example 2**

Convert 78 to a percent.

**Solution:**

To get the denominator of this fraction equal to 100, we have to multiply it by 12.5. Multiplying the
numerator by 12.5 also, we get 87.5
                               100 , which is equivalent to 87.5%.
But what about a fraction like 16 , where there’s no convenient number to multiply the denominator by to
get 100? In a case like this, it’s easier to do the division problem suggested by the fraction in order to
convert the fraction to a decimal, and then convert the decimal to a percent. 1 divided by 6 works out to
0.166666.... Moving the decimal two spaces to the right tells us that this is equivalent to about 16.7%.
Why can we convert from decimals to percents just by moving the decimal point? Because of what decimal
places represent. 0.1 is another way of representing one tenth, and 0.01 is equal to one hundredth—and
one hundredth is one percent. By the same logic, 0.02 is 2 percent, 0.35 is 35 percent, and so on.

**Example 3**

Convert 2.64 to a percent.

**Solution:**

To convert to a percent, simply move the decimal two places to the right. 2.64 = 264%.
Does a percentage greater than 100 even make sense? Sure it does—percentages greater than 100 come
up in real life all the time. For example, a business that made 10 million dollars last year and 13 million
dollars this year would have made 130% as much money this year as it did last year.
The only situation where a percentage greater than 100 doesn’t make sense is when you’re talking about
dividing up something that you only have a ﬁxed amount of—for example, if you took a survey and found
that 56% of the respondents gave one answer and 72% gave another answer (for a total of 128%), you’d
know something went wrong with your math somewhere, because there’s no way you could have gotten
answers from more than 100% of the people you surveyed.

Converting percentages to decimals is just as easy as converting decimals to percentages—simply move the
decimal to the left instead of to the right.

**Example 4**

Convert 58% to a decimal.

**Solution:**

The decimal point here is invisible—it’s right after the 8. So moving it to the left two places gives us 0.58.
It can be hard to remember which way to move the decimal point when converting from decimals to
percents or vice versa. One way to check if you’re moving it the right way is to check whether your answer
is a bigger or smaller number than you started out with. If you’re converting from percents to decimals,
you should end up with a smaller number—just think of how a number like 50 percent, where 50 is greater
than 1, represents a fraction like 12 (or 0.50 in decimal form), where 12 is less than 1. Conversely, if you’re
converting from decimals to percents, you should end up with a bigger number.
One way you might remember this is by remembering that a percent sign is bigger than a decimal point—so
percents should be bigger numbers than decimals.

**Example 5**

Convert 3.4 to a percent.

**Solution:**

If you move the decimal point to the left, you get 0.034%. That’s a smaller number than you started out
with, but you’re moving from decimals to percents, so you want the number to get bigger, not smaller.
Move it to the right instead to get 340%.
Now let’s try another fraction.

**Example 6**

Convert 72 to a percent.

**Solution:**

7 doesn’t convert easily unless you change it to a decimal ﬁrst. 2 divided by 7 is approximately 0.285714...,
and moving the decimal and rounding gives us 28.6%.
The following Khan Academy video shows several more examples of ﬁnding percents and might be useful
for further practice: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SpE4hQ8D_o.


Use the Percent Equation
The percent equation is often used to solve problems. It goes like this:

                                             Rate × Total = Part
                                                      or
                                             R% of Total is Part

Rate is the ratio that the percent represents (R% in the second version).
Total is often called the base unit.
Part is the amount we are comparing with the base unit.

**Example 7**

Find 25% of $80.


**Solution:**

We are looking for the part. The total is $80. ‘of’ means multiply. R% is 25%, so we can use the second
form of the equation: 25% of $80 is Part, or 0.25 × 80 = Part.
0.25 × 80 = 20, so the Part we are looking for is $20.

**Example 8**

Express $90 as a percentage of $160.

**Solution:**

This time we are looking for the rate. We are given the part ($90) and the total ($160). Using the rate
equation, we get Rate × 160 = 90. Dividing both sides by 160 tells us that the rate is 0.5625, or 56.25%.

**Example 9**

$50 is 15% of what total sum?
This time we are looking for the total. We are given the part ($50) and the rate (15%, or 0.15). Using
the rate equation, we get 0.15 × Total = $50. Dividing both sides by 0.15, we get Total = 0.15
                                                                                               ≈ 333.33. So
$50 is 15% of $333.33.


Find Percent of Change
A useful way to express changes in quantities is through percents. You’ve probably seen signs such as
“20% extra free,” or “save 35% today.” When we use percents to represent a change, we generally use the
formula
                                             ﬁnal amount - original amount
                         Percent change =                                  × 100%
                                                    original amount

or
                                     percent change    actual change
                                                    =
                                          100         original amount

This means that a positive percent change is an increase, while a negative change is a decrease.

**Example 10**

A school of 500 students is expecting a 20% increase in students next year. How many students will the
school have?

**Solution:**

First let’s solve this using the ﬁrst formula. Since the 20% change is an increase, we represent it in the
formula as 20 (if it were a decrease, it would be -20.) Plugging in all the numbers, we get
                                             ﬁnal amount − 500
                                     20% =                     × 100%

Dividing both sides by 100%, we get 0.2 = ﬁnal amount−500
                                                500       .
Multiplying both sides by 500 gives us 100 = ﬁnal amount − 500.
Then adding 500 to both sides gives us 600 as the ﬁnal number of students.
How about if we use the second formula? Then we get 100   20
                                                             = actual500
                                                                       change
                                                                               . (Reducing the ﬁrst fraction to
1                                                                1      actual change
5 will make the problem easier, so let’s rewrite the equation as 5 =         500

Cross multiplying is our next step; that gives us 500 = 5 × (actual change). Dividing by 5 tells us the
change is equal to 100. We were told this was an increase, so if we start out with 500 students, after an
increase of 100 we know there will be a total of 600.
Markup
A markup is an increase from the price a store pays for an item from its supplier to the retail price it
charges to the public. For example, a 100% mark-up (commonly known in business as keystone) means
that the price is doubled. Half of the retail price covers the cost of the item from the supplier, half is proﬁt.

**Example 11**

A furniture store places a 30% markup on everything it sells. It oﬀers its employees a 20% discount from
the sales price. The employees are demanding a 25% discount, saying that the store would still make a
proﬁt. The manager says that at a 25% discount from the sales price would cause the store to lose money.
Who is right?

**Solution:**

We’ll consider this problem two ways. First, let’s consider an item that the store buys from its supplier for
a certain price, say $1000. The markup would be 30% of 1000, or $300, so the item would sell for $1300
and the store would make a $300 proﬁt.
And what if an employee buys the product? With a discount of 20%, the employee would pay 80% of the
$1300 retail price, or 0.8 × $1300 = $1040.
But with a 25% discount, the employee would pay 75% of the retail price, or 0.75 × $1300 = $975.
So with a 20% employee discount, the store still makes a $40 proﬁt on the item they bought for $1000—but
with a 25% employee discount, the store loses $25 on the item.
Now let’s use algebra to see how this works for an item of any price. If x is the price of an item, then
the store’s markup is 30% of x, or 0.3x, and the retail price of the item is x + 0.3x, or 1.3x. An employee
buying the item at a 20% discount would pay 0.8 × 1.3x = 1.04x, while an employee buying it at a 25%
discount would pay 0.75 × 1.3x = 0.975x.
So the manager is right: a 20% employee discount still allows the store to make a proﬁt, while a 25%
employee discount would cause the store to lose money.
It may not seem to make sense that the store would lose money after applying a 30% markup and only a
25% discount. The reason it does work out that way is that the discount is bigger in absolute dollars after
the markup is factored in. That is, an employee getting 25% oﬀ an item is getting 25% oﬀ the original
price plus 25% oﬀ the 30% markup, and those two numbers together add up to more than 30% of the
original price.


Solve Real-World Problems Using Percents

**Example 12**

In 2004 the US Department of Agriculture had 112071 employees, of which 87846 were Caucasian. Of the
remaining minorities, African-American and Hispanic employees had the two largest demographic groups,
with 11754 and 6899 employees respectively.∗
a) Calculate the total percentage of minority (non-Caucasian) employees at the USDA.
b) Calculate the percentage of African-American employees at the USDA.
c) Calculate the percentage of minority employees who were neither African-American nor Hispanic.

**Solution:**


a) Use the percent equation Rate × Total = Part.
The total number of employees is 112071. We know that the number of Caucasian employees is 87846,
which means that there must be 112071 − 87646 = 24225 non-Caucasian employees. This is the part.
Plugging in the total and the part, we get Rate × 112071 = 24225.
Divide both sides by 112071 to get Rate = 112071 ≈ 0.216. Multiply by 100 to get this as a percent: 21.6%.
21.6% of USDA employees in 2004 were from minority groups.
b) Here, the total is still 112071 and the part is 11754, so we have Rate × 112071 = 11754. Dividing, we
get Rate = 112071 ≈ 0.105, or 10.5%.
10.5% of USDA employees in 2004 were African-American.
c) Here, our total is just the number of non-Caucasian employees, which we found out is 24225. Subtracting
the African-American and Hispanic employees leaves 24225 − 11754 − 6899 = 5572 employees in the group
we’re looking at.
So with 24225 for the whole and 5572 for the part, our equation is Rate × 24225 = 5572, or Rate = 24225
                                                                                                        ≈
0.230, or 23%.
23% of USDA minority employees in 2004 were neither African-American nor Hispanic.

**Example 13**

In 1995 New York had 18136000 residents. There were 827025 reported crimes, of which 152683 were
violent. By 2005 the population was 19254630 and there were 85839 violent crimes out of a total of 491829
reported crimes. (Source: New York Law Enforcement Agency Uniform Crime Reports.) Calculate the
percentage change from 1995 to 2005 in:
a) Population of New York
b) Total reported crimes
c) violent crimes

**Solution:**

This is a percentage change problem. Remember the formula for percentage change:


                                           ﬁnal amount - original amount
                        Percent change =                                 × 100%
                                                  original amount


In these problems, the ﬁnal amount is the 2005 statistic, and the initial amount is the 1995 statistic.
a) Population:

                                                19254630 − 18136000
                             Percent change =                       × 100%
                                             =            × 100%
                                             ≈ 0.0617 × 100%
                                             = 6.17%


The population grew by 6.17%.
b) Total reported crimes:

                                                491829 − 827025
                               Percent change =                 × 100%
                                                −335196
                                              =          × 100%
                                              ≈ −0.4053 × 100%
                                              = −40.53%

The total number of reported crimes fell by 40.53%.
c) Violent crimes:
                                                 85839 − 152683
                               Percent change =                 × 100%
                                                 −66844
                                               =         × 100%
                                               ≈ −0.4377 × 100%
                                               = −43.77%

The total number of violent crimes fell by 43.77%.


Lesson Summary
- A percent is simply a ratio with a base unit of 100—for example, 13% = 100       .
- The percent equation is Rate × Total = Part, or R% of Total is Part.
- The percent change equation is Percent change = ﬁnal amount    - original amount
                                                             original amount          × 100%. A positive
    percent change means the value increased, while a negative percent change means the value de-
    creased.

Introduction

Lydia lives 2 blocks north and one block east of school; Travis lives three blocks south and two blocks west
of school. What’s the shortest line connecting their houses?


The Coordinate Plane

We’ve seen how to represent numbers using number lines; now we’ll see how to represent sets of numbers
using a coordinate plane. The coordinate plane can be thought of as two number lines that meet at
right angles. The horizontal line is called the x−axis and the vertical line is the y−axis. Together the lines
are called the axes, and the point at which they cross is called the origin. The axes split the coordinate
plane into four quadrants, which are numbered sequentially (I, II, III, IV) moving counter-clockwise from
the upper right.

Identify Coordinates of Points
When given a point on a coordinate plane, it’s easy to determine its coordinates. The coordinates of
a point are two numbers - written together they are called an ordered pair. The numbers describe
how far along the x−axis and y−axis the point is. The ordered pair is written in parentheses, with the
x−coordinate (also called the abscissa) ﬁrst and the y−coordinate (or the ordinate) second.

       (1, 7)                  An ordered pair with an x − value of one and a y − value of seven
       (0, 5)                  An ordered pair with an x − value of zero and a y − value of ﬁve
       (−2.5, 4)               An ordered pair with an x − value of -2.5 and a y − value of four
       (−107.2, −.005)         An ordered pair with an x − value of -107.2 and a y − value of − .005

Identifying coordinates is just like reading points on a number line, except that now the points do not
actually lie on the number line! Look at the following example.

**Example 1**


Find the coordinates of the point labeled P in the diagram above

**Solution:**

Imagine you are standing at the origin (the point where the x−axis meets the y−axis). In order to move
to a position where P was directly above you, you would move 3 units to the right (we say this is in the
positive x−direction).
The x−coordinate of P is +3.
Now if you were standing at the 3 marker on the x−axis, point P would be 7 units above you (above the
axis means it is in the positive y direction).

The y−coordinate of P is +7.
The coordinates of point P are (3, 7).

**Example 2**


Find the coordinates of the points labeled Q and R in the diagram to the right.

**Solution:**

In order to get to Q we move three units to the right, in the positive x−direction, then two units down.
This time we are moving in the negative y−direction. The x−coordinate of Q is +3, the y−coordinate of
Q is −2.
The coordinates of R are found in a similar way. The x−coordinate is +5 (ﬁve units in the positive
x−direction) and the y−coordinate is again −2.
The coordinates of Q are (3, −2). The coordinates of R are (5, −2).

**Example 3**

Triangle ABC is shown in the diagram to the right. Find the coordinates of the vertices A, B and C.


Point A:
x − coordinate = −2
y − coordinate = +5
Point B:
x − coordinate = +3
y − coordinate = −3


Point C:
x − coordinate = −4
y − coordinate = −1

**Solution:**

A(−2, 5)
B(3, −3)
C(−4, −1)


Plot Points in a Coordinate Plane

Plotting points is simple, once you understand how to read coordinates and read the scale on a graph. As
a note on scale, in the next two examples pay close attention to the labels on the axes.

**Example 4**

Plot the following points on the coordinate plane.
A(2, 7)    B(−4, 6)   D(−3, −3)   E(0, 2)   F(7, −5)


Point A(2, 7) is 2 units right, 7 units up. It is in Quadrant I.
Point B(−4, 6) is 4 units left, 6 units up. It is in Quadrant II.
Point D(−3, −3) is 3 units left, 3 units down. It is in Quadrant III.
Point E(0, 2) is 2 units up from the origin. It is right on the y−axis, between Quadrants I and II.
Point F(7, −5) is 7 units right, 5 units down. It is in Quadrant IV.

**Example 5**

Plot the following points on the coordinate plane.
A(2.5, 0.5)   B(π, 1.2) C(2, 1.75)   D(0.1, 1.2)   E(0, 0)

Here we see the importance of choosing the right scale and range for the graph. In Example 4, our points
were scattered throughout the four quadrants. In this case, all the coordinates are positive, so we don’t
need to show the negative values of x or y. Also, there are no x−values bigger than about 3.14, and 1.75 is
the largest value of y. We can therefore show just the part of the coordinate plane where 0 ≤ x ≤ 3.5 and
0 ≤ y ≤ 2.
Here are some other important things to notice about this graph:


- The tick marks on the axes don’t correspond to unit increments (i.e. the numbers do not go up by
    one each time). This is so that we can plot the points more precisely.
- The scale on the x−axis is diﬀerent than the scale on the y−axis, so distances that look the same on
    both axes are actually greater in the x−direction. Stretching or shrinking the scale in one direction
    can be useful when the points we want to plot are farther apart in one direction than the other.

Game at http://www.math-play.com/Coordinate%20Plane%20Game/Coordinate%20Plane%20Game.html.


Graph a Function Given a Table
Once we know how to plot points on a coordinate plane, we can think about how we’d go about plotting
a relationship between x−and y−values. So far we’ve just been plotting sets of ordered pairs. A set like
that is a relation, and there isn’t necessarily a relationship between the x−values and y−values. If there
is a relationship between the x−and y−values, and each x−value corresponds to exactly one y−value, then
the relation is called a function. Remember that a function is a particular way to relate one quantity to
another.
If you’re reading a book and can read twenty pages an hour, there is a relationship between how many
hours you read and how many pages you read. You may even know that you could write the formula as
                       n
either n = 20h or h = 20 , where h is the number of hours you spend reading and n is the number of pages
you read. To ﬁnd out, for example, how many pages you could read in 3 12 hours, or how many hours it
would take you to read 46 pages, you could use one of those formulas. Or, you could make a graph of the
function:

Once you know how to graph a function like this, you can simply read the relationship between the x−and
y−values oﬀ the graph. You can see in this case that you could read 70 pages in 3 12 hours, and it would
take you about 2 13 hours to read 46 pages.
Generally, the graph of a function appears as a line or curve that goes through all points that have the
relationship that the function describes. If the domain of the function (the set of x−values we can plug into
the function) is all real numbers, then we call it a continuous function. If the domain of the function is
a particular set of values (such as whole numbers only), then it is called a discrete function. The graph
will be a series of dots, but they will still often fall along a line or curve.
In graphing equations, we assume the domain is all real numbers, unless otherwise stated. Often, though,
when we look at data in a table, the domain will be whole numbers (number of presents, number of days,
etc.) and the function will be discrete. But sometimes we’ll still draw the graph as a continuous line to
make it easier to interpret. Be aware of the diﬀerence between discrete and continuous functions as you
work through the examples.

**Example 6**

Sarah is thinking of the number of presents she receives as a function of the number of friends who come
to her birthday party. She knows she will get a present from her parents, one from her grandparents and
one each from her uncle and aunt. She wants to invite up to ten of her friends, who will each bring one
present. She makes a table of how many presents she will get if one, two, three, four or ﬁve friends come
to the party. Plot the points on a coordinate plane and graph the function that links the number of presents
with the number of friends. Use your graph to determine how many presents she would get if eight friends
show up.

                                                Table 4.1:

 Number of Friends                                     Number of Presents
 0                                                     4
 1                                                     5
 2                                                     6
 3                                                     7
 4                                                     8
 5                                                     9


The ﬁrst thing we need to do is decide how our graph should appear. We need to decide what the
independent variable is, and what the dependant variable is. Clearly in this case, the number of friends
can vary independently, but the number of presents must depend on the number of friends who show up.

So we’ll plot friends on the x−axis and presents on the y−axis. Let’s add another column to our table
containing the coordinates that each (friends, presents) ordered pair gives us.

                                                 Table 4.2:

 Friends (x)                          Presents (y)                         Coordinates (x, y)
 0                                    4                                    (0, 4)
 1                                    5                                    (1, 5)
 2                                    6                                    (2, 6)
 3                                    7                                    (3, 7)
 4                                    8                                    (4, 8)
 5                                    9                                    (5, 9)


Next we need to set up our axes. It is clear that the number of friends and number of presents both must
be positive, so we only need to show points in Quadrant I. Now we need to choose a suitable scale for the
x− and y−axes. We only need to consider eight friends (look again at the question to conﬁrm this), but
it always pays to allow a little extra room on your graph. We also need the y−scale to accommodate the
presents for eight people. We can see that this is still going to be under 20!


The scale of this graph has room for up to 12 friends and 15 presents. This will be ﬁne, but there are many
other scales that would be equally good!
Now we proceed to plot the points. The ﬁrst ﬁve points are the coordinates from our table. You can see
they all lie on a straight line, so the function that describes the relationship between x and y will be linear.
To graph the function, we simply draw a line that goes through all ﬁve points. This line represents the
function.
This is a discrete problem since Sarah can only invite a positive whole number of friends. For instance, it
would be impossible for 2.4 or -3 friends to show up. So although the line helps us see where the other
values of the function are, the only points on the line that actually are values of the function are the ones
with positive whole-number coordinates.
The graph easily lets us ﬁnd other values for the function. For example, the question asks how many
presents Sarah would get if eight friends come to her party. Don’t forget that x represents the number of
friends and y represents the number of presents. If we look at the graph where x = 8, we can see that the
function has a y−value of 12.

**Solution:**

If 8 friends show up, Sarah will receive a total of 12 presents.

Graph a Function Given a Rule
If we are given a rule instead of a table, we can proceed to graph the function in either of two ways. We
will use the following example to show each way.

**Example 7**

Ali is trying to work out a trick that his friend showed him. His friend started by asking him to think of a
number, then double it, then add ﬁve to the result. Ali has written down a rule to describe the ﬁrst part of
the trick. He is using the letter x to stand for the number he thought of and the letter y to represent the
ﬁnal result of applying the rule. He wrote his rule in the form of an equation: y = 2x + 5.
Help him visualize what is going on by graphing the function that this rule describes.
Method One - Construct a Table of Values
If we wish to plot a few points to see what is going on with this function, then the best way is to construct
a table and populate it with a few (x, y) pairs. We’ll use 0, 1, 2 and 3 for x−values.

                                                Table 4.3:

 x                                                     y
 0                                                     5
 1                                                     7
 2                                                     9
 3                                                     11


Next, we plot the points and join them with a line.


This method is nice and simple—especially with linear relationships, where we don’t need to plot more
than two or three points to see the shape of the graph. In this case, the function is continuous because
the domain is all real numbers—that is, Ali could think of any real number, even though he may only be
thinking of positive whole numbers.
Method Two - Intercept and Slope

Another way to graph this function (one that we’ll learn in more detail in a later lesson) is the slope-
intercept method. To use this method, follow these steps:
1. Find the y value when y = 0.
y(0) = 2 · 0 + 5 = 5, so our y−intercept is (0, 5).
2. Look at the coeﬀicient multiplying the x.
Every time we increase x by one, y increases by two, so our slope is +2.
3. Plot the line with the given slope that goes through the intercept. We start at the point (0, 5) and
move over one in the x−direction, then up two in the y−direction. This gives the slope for our line, which
we extend in both directions.
We will properly examine this last method later in this chapter!


Lesson Summary


- The coordinate plane is a two-dimensional space deﬁned by a horizontal number line (the x−axis)
    and a vertical number line (the y−axis). The origin is the point where these two lines meet. Four
    areas, or quadrants, are formed as shown in the diagram above.
- Each point on the coordinate plane has a set of coordinates, two numbers written as an ordered
    pair which describe how far along the x−axis and y−axis the point is. The x−coordinate is always
    written ﬁrst, then the y−coordinate, in the form (x, y).
- Functions are a way that we can relate one quantity to another. Functions can be plotted on the
    coordinate plane.

## 4.2 Graphs of Linear Equations


### Learning Objectives

- Graph a linear function using an equation.
- Write equations and graph horizontal and vertical lines.
- Analyze graphs of linear functions and read conversion graphs.


Introduction
You’re stranded downtown late at night with only $8 in your pocket, and your home is 6 miles away. Two
cab companies serve this area; one charges $1.20 per mile with an additional $1 fee, and the other charges
$0.90 per mile with an additional $2.50 fee. Which cab will be able to get you home?


Graph a Linear Equation
At the end of Lesson 4.1 we looked at ways to graph a function from a rule. A rule is a way of writing the
relationship between the two quantities we are graphing. In mathematics, we tend to use the words formula
and equation to describe the rules we get when we express relationships algebraically. Interpreting and
graphing these equations is an important skill that you’ll use frequently in math.

**Example 1**

A taxi costs more the further you travel. Taxis usually charge a fee on top of the per-mile charge to cover
hire of the vehicle. In this case, the taxi charges $3 as a set fee and $0.80 per mile traveled. Here is the
equation linking the cost in dollars (y) to hire a taxi and the distance traveled in miles (x).

                                                 y = 0.8x + 3

Graph the equation and use your graph to estimate the cost of a seven-mile taxi ride.

**Solution:**

We’ll start by making a table of values. We will take a few values for x (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4), ﬁnd the
corresponding y−values, and then plot them. Since the question asks us to ﬁnd the cost for a seven-mile
journey, we need to choose a scale that can accommodate this.
First, here’s our table of values:

                                                 Table 4.4:

 x                                                      y
 0                                                      3
 1                                                      3.8
 2                                                      4.6
 3                                                      5.4
 4                                                      6.2


And here’s our graph:


To ﬁnd the cost of a seven-mile journey, ﬁrst we ﬁnd x = 7 on the horizontal axis and draw a line up to
our graph. Next, we draw a horizontal line across to the y−axis and read where it hits. It appears to hit
around half way between y = 8 and y = 9. Let’s call it 8.5.
A seven mile taxi ride would cost approximately $8.50 ($8.60 exactly).
Here are some things you should notice about this graph and the formula that generated it:

- The graph is a straight line (this means that the equation is linear), although the function is discrete
       and really just consists of a series of points.
- The graph crosses the y−axis at y = 3 (notice that there’s a + 3 in the equation—that’s not a
       coincidence!). This is the base cost of the taxi.
- Every time we move over by one square we move up by 0.8 squares (notice that that’s also the
       coeﬀicient of x in the equation). This is the rate of charge of the taxi (cost per mile).
- If we move over by three squares, we move up by 3 × 0.8 squares.


**Example 2**

A small business has a debt of $500,000 incurred from start-up costs. It predicts that it can pay oﬀ the
debt at a rate of $85,000 per year according to the following equation governing years in business (x) and
debt measured in thousands of dollars (y).

                                                y = −85x + 500

Graph the above equation and use your graph to predict when the debt will be fully paid.

**Solution:**

First, we start with our table of values:

                                                  Table 4.5:

 x                                                       y
 0                                                       500
 1                                                       415
 2                                                       330
 3                                                       245
 4                                                       160

Then we plot our points and draw the line that goes through them:


Notice the scale we’ve chosen here. There’s no need to include any points above y = 500, but it’s still wise
to allow a little extra.
Next we need to determine how many years it takes the debt to reach zero, or in other words, what x−value
will make the y−value equal 0. We know it’s greater than four (since at x = 4 the y−value is still positive),
so we need an x−scale that goes well past x = 4. Here we’ve chosen to show the x−values from 0 to 12,
though there are many other places we could have chosen to stop.
To read the time that the debt is paid oﬀ, we simply read the point where the line hits y = 0 (the x−axis).
It looks as if the line hits pretty close to x = 6. So the debt will deﬁnitely be paid oﬀ in six years.
To see more simple examples of graphing linear equations by hand, see the Khan Academy video on
graphing lines at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UrcUfBizyw. The narrator shows how to graph
several linear equations, using a table of values to plot points and then connecting the points with a line.


Graphs and Equations of Horizontal and Vertical Lines


**Example 3**

“Mad-cabs” have an unusual oﬀer going on. They are charging $7.50 for a taxi ride of any length within
the city limits. Graph the function that relates the cost of hiring the taxi (y) to the length of the journey
in miles (x).
To proceed, the ﬁrst thing we need is an equation. You can see from the problem that the cost of a
journey doesn’t depend on the length of the journey. It should come as no surprise that the equation then,
does not have x in it. Since any value of x results in the same value of y(7.5), the value you choose for x
doesn’t matter, so it isn’t included in the equation. Here is the equation:
y = 7.5
The graph of this function is shown below. You can see that it’s simply a horizontal line.

Any time you see an equation of the form “y = constant,” the graph is a horizontal line that intercepts the
y−axis at the value of the constant.
Similarly, when you see an equation of the form x = constant, then the graph is a vertical line that
intercepts the x−axis at the value of the constant. (Notice that that kind of equation is a relation, and not
a function, because each x−value (there’s only one in this case) corresponds to many (actually an inﬁnite
number) y−values.)

**Example 4**

Plot the following graphs.
(a) y = 4
(b) y = −4
(c) x = 4
(d) x = −4


(a) y = 4 is a horizontal line that crosses the y−axis at 4.
(b) y = −4 is a horizontal line that crosses the y−axis at −4.
(c) x = 4 is a vertical line that crosses the x−axis at 4.
(d) x = −4 is a vertical line that crosses the x−axis at −4.

**Example 5**

Find an equation for the x−axis and the y−axis.
Look at the axes on any of the graphs from previous examples. We have already said that they intersect
at the origin (the point where x = 0 and y = 0). The following deﬁnition could easily work for each axis.

x−axis: A horizontal line crossing the y−axis at zero.
y−axis: A vertical line crossing the x−axis at zero.
So using example 3 as our guide, we could deﬁne the x−axis as the line y = 0 and the y−axis as the line
x = 0.


Analyze Graphs of Linear Functions
We often use graphs to represent relationships between two linked quantities. It’s useful to be able to
interpret the information that graphs convey. For example, the chart below shows a ﬂuctuating stock price
over ten weeks. You can read that the index closed the ﬁrst week at about $68, and at the end of the
third week it was at about $62. You may also see that in the ﬁrst ﬁve weeks it lost about 20% of its value,
and that it made about 20% gain between weeks seven and ten. Notice that this relationship is discrete,
although the dots are connected to make the graph easier to interpret.


Analyzing graphs is a part of life - whether you are trying to decide to buy stock, ﬁgure out if your
blog readership is increasing, or predict the temperature from a weather report. Many graphs are very
complicated, so for now we’ll start oﬀ with some simple linear conversion graphs. Algebra starts with basic
relationships and builds to more complicated tasks, like reading the graph above.

**Example 6**

Below is a graph for converting marked prices in a downtown store into prices that include sales tax. Use
the graph to determine the cost including sales tax for a $6.00 pen in the store.


To ﬁnd the relevant price with tax, ﬁrst ﬁnd the correct pre-tax price on the x−axis. This is the point
x = 6.
Draw the line x = 6 up until it meets the function, then draw a horizontal line to the y−axis. This line
hits at y ≈ 6.75 (about three fourths of the way from y = 6 to y = 7).

The approximate cost including tax is $6.75.


**Example 7**

The chart for converting temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius is shown to the right. Use the graph to
convert the following:
a) 70◦ Fahrenheit to Celsius
b) 0◦ Fahrenheit to Celsius
c) 30◦ Celsius to Fahrenheit
d) 0◦ Celsius to Fahrenheit

**Solution:**

a) To ﬁnd 70◦ Fahrenheit, we look along the Fahrenheit-axis (in other words the x−axis) and draw the line
x = 70 up to the function. Then we draw a horizontal line to the Celsius-axis (y−axis). The horizontal line
hits the axis at a little over 20 (21 or 22).
70◦ Fahrenheit is approximately equivalent to 21◦ Celsius.
b) To ﬁnd 0◦ Fahrenheit, we just look at the y−axis. (Don’t forget that this axis is simply the line x = 0.)
The line hits the y−axis just below the half way point between −15 and −20.
0◦ Fahrenheit is approximately equivalent to −18◦ Celsius.
c) To ﬁnd 30◦ Celsius, we look up the Celsius-axis and draw the line y = 30 along to the function. When
this horizontal line hits the function, we draw a line straight down to the Fahrenheit-axis. The line hits
the axis at approximately 85.
30◦ Celsius is approximately equivalent to 85◦ Fahrenheit.
d) To ﬁnd 0◦ Celsius, we look at the Fahrenheit-axis (the line y = 0). The function hits the x−axis just
right of 30.
0◦ Celsius is equivalent to 32◦ Fahrenheit.


Lesson Summary
- Equations with the variables y and x can be graphed by making a chart of values that ﬁt the equation
    and then plotting the values on a coordinate plane. This graph is simply another representation of
    the equation and can be analyzed to solve problems.
- Horizontal lines are deﬁned by the equation y = constant and vertical lines are deﬁned by the equation
    x = constant.
- Be aware that although we graph the function as a line to make it easier to interpret, the function

    may actually be discrete.

Introduction

Sanjit’s oﬀice is 25 miles from home, and in traﬀic he expects the trip home to take him an hour if he
starts at 5 PM. Today he hopes to stop at the post oﬀice along the way. If the post oﬀice is 6 miles from
his oﬀice, when will Sanjit get there?

If you know just one of the points on a line, you’ll ﬁnd that isn’t enough information to plot the line on a
graph. As you can see in the graph above, there are many lines—in fact, inﬁnitely many lines—that pass
through a single point. But what if you know two points that are both on the line? Then there’s only
one way to graph that line; all you need to do is plot the two points and use a ruler to draw the line that
passes through both of them.
There are a lot of options for choosing which two points on the line you use to plot it. In this lesson, we’ll
focus on two points that are rather convenient for graphing: the points where our line crosses the x−and
y−axes, or intercepts. We’ll see how to ﬁnd intercepts algebraically and use them to quickly plot graphs.


Look at the graph above. The y−intercept occurs at the point where the graph crosses the y−axis. The
y−value at this point is 8, and the x−value is 0.
Similarly, the x−intercept occurs at the point where the graph crosses the x−axis. The x−value at this
point is 6, and the y−value is 0.
So we know the coordinates of two points on the graph: (0, 8) and (6, 0). If we’d just been given those
two coordinates out of the blue, we could quickly plot those points and join them with a line to recreate
the above graph.
Note: Not all lines will have both an x−and a y−intercept, but most do. However, horizontal lines never
cross the x−axis and vertical lines never cross the y−axis.
For examples of these special cases, see the graph below.


Finding Intercepts by Substitution

**Example 1**

Find the intercepts of the line y = 13 − x and use them to graph the function.

**Solution:**

The ﬁrst intercept is easy to ﬁnd. The y−intercept occurs when x = 0. Substituting gives us y = 13−0 = 13,
so the y−intercept is (0, 13).
Similarly, the x−intercept occurs when y = 0. Plugging in 0 for y gives us 0 = 13 − x, and adding x to both
sides gives us x = 13. So (13, 0) is the x−intercept.
To draw the graph, simply plot these points and join them with a line.


**Example 2**

Graph the following functions by ﬁnding intercepts.
a) y = 2x + 3
b) y = 7 − 2x
c) 4x − 2y = 8
d) 2x + 3y = −6

**Solution:**

a) Find the y−intercept by plugging in x = 0 :

                             y=2·0+3=3            − the y − intercept is (0, 3)

Find the x−intercept by plugging in y = 0 :

                               0 = 2x + 3        − subtract 3 f rom both sides :
                             −3 = 2x             − divide by 2 :
                             − =x                − the x − intercept is (−1.5, 0)


b) Find the y−intercept by plugging in x = 0 :

                             y=7−2·0=7              − the y − intercept is (0, 7)

Find the x−intercept by plugging in y = 0 :

                               0 = 7 − 2x        − subtract 7 f rom both sides :
                              −7 = −2x           − divide by − 2 :
                                 =x              − the x − intercept is (3.5, 0)


c) Find the y−intercept by plugging in x = 0 :

                             4 · 0 − 2y = 8
                                  −2y = 8          − divide by − 2
                                     y = −4        − the y − intercept is (0, −4)

Find the x−intercept by plugging in y = 0 :

                              4x − 2 · 0 = 8
                                     4x = 8      − divide by 4 :
                                      x=2        − the x − intercept is (2, 0)


d) Find the y−intercept by plugging in x = 0 :

                             2 · 0 + 3y = −6
                                   3y = −6       − divide by 3 :
                                     y = −2      − the y − intercept is (0, −2)

Find the x−intercept by plugging in y = 0 :

                            2x + 3 · 0 = −6
                                   2x = −6       − divide by 2 :
                                     x = −3      − the x − intercept is (−3, 0)


Finding Intercepts for Standard Form Equations Using the Cover-
Up Method
Look at the last two equations in example 2. These equations are written in standard form. Standard
form equations are always written “coeﬀicient times x plus (or minus) coeﬀicient times y equals value”.
In other words, they look like this:

                                                  ax + by = c

where a has to be positive, but b and c do not.
There is a neat method for ﬁnding intercepts in standard form, often referred to as the cover-up method.

**Example 3**

Find the intercepts of the following equations:
a) 7x − 3y = 21
b) 12x − 10y = −15
c) x + 3y = 6

**Solution:**

To solve for each intercept, we realize that at the intercepts the value of either x or y is zero, and so any
terms that contain that variable eﬀectively drop out of the equation. To make a term disappear, simply
cover it (a ﬁnger is an excellent way to cover up terms) and solve the resulting equation.
a) To solve for the y−intercept we set x = 0 and cover up the x−term:


−3y = 21
y = −7   (0, −7) is the y − intercept.
Now we solve for the x−intercept:


7x = 21
x=3     (3, 0) is the x − intercept.
b) To solve for the y−intercept (x = 0), cover up the x−term:


−10y = −15
y = 1.5   (0, 1.5) is the y − intercept.
Now solve for the x−intercept (y = 0):


12x = −15
x = − 54  (−1.25, 0) is the x − intercept.
c) To solve for the y−intercept (x = 0), cover up the x−term:


3y = 6
y=2       (0, 2) is the y − intercept.
Solve for the y−intercept:


x=6       (6, 0) is the x − intercept.
The graph of these functions and the intercepts is below:

the values of a, b, and c and see how that aﬀects the graph.


Solving Real-World Problems Using Intercepts of a Graph

**Example 4**

Jesus has $30 to spend on food for a class barbecue. Hot dogs cost $0.75 each (including the bun) and
burgers cost $1.25 (including the bun). Plot a graph that shows all the combinations of hot dogs and burgers
he could buy for the barbecue, without spending more than $30.
This time we will ﬁnd an equation ﬁrst, and then we can think logically about ﬁnding the intercepts.
If the number of burgers that Jesus buys is x, then the money he spends on burgers is 1.25x
If the number of hot dogs he buys is y, then the money he spends on hot dogs is 0.75y
So the total cost of the food is 1.25x + 0.75y.
The total amount of money he has to spend is $30, so if he is to spend it ALL, we can use the following
equation:

                                             1.25x + 0.75y = 30

We can solve for the intercepts using the cover-up method. First the y−intercept (x = 0):


0.75y = 30
y = 40     y − intercept: (0, 40)

Then the x−intercept (y = 0):


1.25x = 30
x = 24     x − intercept: (24, 0)
Now we plot those two points and join them to create our graph, shown here:


We could also have created this graph without needing to come up with an equation. We know that if
John were to spend ALL the money on hot dogs, he could buy .75   = 40 hot dogs. And if he were to buy
only burgers he could buy 1.25 = 24 burgers. From those numbers, we can get 2 intercepts: (0 burgers, 40
hot dogs) and (24 burgers, 0 hot dogs). We could plot these just as we did above and obtain our graph
that way.
As a ﬁnal note, we should realize that Jesus’ problem is really an example of an inequality. He can, in
fact, spend any amount up to $30. The only thing he cannot do is spend more than $30. The graph above
reﬂects this: the line is the set of solutions that involve spending exactly $30, and the shaded region shows
solutions that involve spending less than $30. We’ll work with inequalities some more in Chapter 6.


Lesson Summary
- A y−intercept occurs at the point where a graph crosses the y−axis (where x = 0) and an x−intercept
    occurs at the point where a graph crosses the x−axis (where y = 0).
- The y−intercept can be found by substituting x = 0 into the equation and solving for y. Likewise,
    the x−intercept can be found by substituting y = 0 into the equation and solving for x.
- A linear equation is in standard form if it is written as “positive coeﬀicient times x plus coeﬀicient
    times y equals value”. Equations in standard form can be solved for the intercepts by covering up
    the x (or y) term and solving the equation that remains.

## 4.4 Slope and Rate of Change


### Learning Objectives

- Find positive and negative slopes.
- Recognize and ﬁnd slopes for horizontal and vertical lines.
- Understand rates of change.
- Interpret graphs and compare rates of change.


Introduction
                                                                     1       1
Wheelchair ramps at building entrances must have a slope between 16     and 20 . If the entrance to a new
oﬀice building is 28 inches oﬀ the ground, how long does the wheelchair ramp need to be?
We come across many examples of slope in everyday life. For example, a slope is in the pitch of a roof, the
grade or incline of a road, or the slant of a ladder leaning on a wall. In math, we use the word slope to
deﬁne steepness in a particular way.

                                               distance moved vertically
                                   Slope =
                                              distance moved horizontally


To make it easier to remember, we often word it like this:


                                                           rise
                                                 Slope =
                                                           run


In the picture above, the slope would be the ratio of the height of the hill to the horizontal length of the
hill. In other words, it would be 34 , or 0.75.
If the car were driving to the right it would climb the hill - we say this is a positive slope. Any time you
see the graph of a line that goes up as you move to the right, the slope is positive.
If the car kept driving after it reached the top of the hill, it might go down the other side. If the car is
driving to the right and descending, then we would say that the slope is negative.


Here’s where it gets tricky: If the car turned around instead and drove back down the left side of the hill,
the slope of that side would still be positive. This is because the rise would be -3, but the run would be -4
(think of the x−axis - if you move from right to left you are moving in the negative x−direction). That
means our slope ratio would be −3  −4 , and the negatives cancel out to leave 0.75, the same slope as before.
In other words, the slope of a line is the same no matter which direction you travel along it.


Find the Slope of a Line
A simple way to ﬁnd a value for the slope of a line is to draw a right triangle whose hypotenuse runs
along the line. Then we just need to measure the distances on the triangle that correspond to the rise (the
vertical dimension) and the run (the horizontal dimension).

**Example 1**

Find the slopes for the three graphs shown.


**Solution:**

There are already right triangles drawn for each of the lines - in future problems you’ll do this part yourself.
Note that it is easiest to make triangles whose vertices are lattice points (i.e. points whose coordinates
are all integers).
a) The rise shown in this triangle is 4 units; the run is 2 units. The slope is 42 = 2.
b) The rise shown in this triangle is 4 units, and the run is also 4 units. The slope is 44 = 1.
c) The rise shown in this triangle is 2 units, and the run is 4 units. The slope is 42 = 12 .

**Example 2**

Find the slope of the line that passes through the points (1, 2) and (4, 7).

**Solution:**

We already know how to graph a line if we’re given two points: we simply plot the points and connect
them with a line. Here’s the graph:


Since we already have coordinates for the vertices of our right triangle, we can quickly work out that the
rise is 7 − 2 = 5 and the run is 4 − 1 = 3 (see diagram). So the slope is 7−2   5
                                                                          4−1 = 3 .
If you look again at the calculations for the slope, you’ll notice that the 7 and 2 are the y−coordinates
of the two points and the 4 and 1 are the x−coordinates. This suggests a pattern we can follow to get a
general formula for the slope between two points (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ):
Slope between (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ) = yx22 −y
                                               −x1


       ∆y
or m = ∆x


In the second equation the letter m denotes the slope (this is a mathematical convention you’ll see often)
and the Greek letter delta (∆) means change. So another way to express slope is change in y divided by
change in x. In the next section, you’ll see that it doesn’t matter which point you choose as point 1 and
which you choose as point 2.

**Example 3**

Find the slopes of the lines on the graph below.


**Solution:**

Look at the lines - they both slant down (or decrease) as we move from left to right. Both these lines have
negative slope.
The lines don’t pass through very many convenient lattice points, but by looking carefully you can see a
few points that look to have integer coordinates. These points have been circled on the graph, and we’ll
use them to determine the slope. We’ll also do our calculations twice, to show that we get the same slope
whichever way we choose point 1 and point 2.
For Line A:

       (x1 , y1 ) = (−6, 3)     (x2 , y2 ) = (5, −1)            (x1 , y1 ) = (5, −1)     (x2 , y2 ) = (−6, 3)
              y2 − y1     (−1) − (3)       −4                          y2 − y1     (3) − (−1)        4
       m=             =                =      ≈ −0.364          m=              =               =       ≈ −0.364
              x2 − x1     (5) − (−6)       11                          x2 − x1     (−6) − (5)       −11

For Line B

       (x1 , y1 ) = (−4, 6)     (x2 , y2 ) = (4, −5)             (x1 , y1 ) = (4, −5)     (x2 , y2 ) = (−4, 6)
              y2 − y1     (−5) − (6)       −11                          y2 − y1     (6) − (−5)       11
       m=             =                =       = −1.375          m=              =               =      = −1.375
              x2 − x1     (4) − (−4)        8                           x2 − x1     (−4) − (4)       −8

You can see that whichever way round you pick the points, the answers are the same. Either way, Line A
has slope -0.364, and Line B has slope -1.375.

Find the Slopes of Horizontal and Vertical lines

**Example 4**

Determine the slopes of the two lines on the graph below.


**Solution:**

There are 2 lines on the graph: A(y = 3) and B(x = 5).
Let’s pick 2 points on line A—say, (x1 , y1 ) = (−4, 3) and (x2 , y2 ) = (5, 3)—and use our equation for slope:


                                            y2 − y1    (3) − (3)  0
                                      m=            =            = = 0.
                                            x2 − x1   (5) − (−4)  9


If you think about it, this makes sense - if y doesn’t change as x increases then there is no slope, or rather,
the slope is zero. You can see that this must be true for all horizontal lines.
Horizontal lines (y = constant) all have a slope of 0.
Now let’s consider line B. If we pick the points (x1 , y1 ) = (5, −3) and (x2 , y2 ) = (5, 4), our slope equation is
         −y1    (4)−(−3)
m = xy22 −x 1
              = (5)−(5) = 70 . But dividing by zero isn’t allowed!
In math we often say that a term which involves division by zero is undeﬁned. (Technically, the answer
can also be said to be inﬁnitely large—or inﬁnitely small, depending on the problem.)
Vertical lines (x = constant) all have an inﬁnite (or undeﬁned) slope.


Find a Rate of Change
The slope of a function that describes real, measurable quantities is often called a rate of change. In that
case the slope refers to a change in one quantity (y) per unit change in another quantity (x). (This is where
                    ∆y
the equation m = ∆x    comes in—remember that ∆y and ∆x represent the change in y and x respectively.)

**Example 5**

A candle has a starting length of 10 inches. 30 minutes after lighting it, the length is 7 inches. Determine
the rate of change in length of the candle as it burns. Determine how long the candle takes to completely
burn to nothing.

**Solution:**

First we’ll graph the function to visualize what is happening. We have 2 points to start with: we know
that at the moment the candle is lit (time = 0) the length of the candle is 10 inches, and after 30 minutes
(time = 30) the length is 7 inches. Since the candle length depends on the time, we’ll plot time on the
horizontal axis, and candle length on the vertical axis.

The rate of change of the candle’s length is simply the slope of the line. Since we have our 2 points
(x1 , y1 ) = (0, 10) and (x2 , y2 ) = (30, 7), we can use the familiar version of the slope formula:


                        y2 − y1     (7 inches) − (10 inches)    −3 inches
     Rate of change =           =                            =            = −0.1 inches per minute
                        x2 − x1   (30 minutes) − (0 minutes)   30 minutes


Note that the slope is negative. A negative rate of change means that the quantity is decreasing with
time—just as we would expect the length of a burning candle to do.
To ﬁnd the point when the candle reaches zero length, we can simply read the x−intercept oﬀ the graph
(100 minutes). We can use the rate equation to verify this algebraically:


                                      Length burned = rate × time
                                                   10 = 0.1 × 100


Since the candle length was originally 10 inches, our equation conﬁrms that 100 minutes is the time taken.

**Example 6**

The population of ﬁsh in a certain lake increased from 370 to 420 over the months of March and April. At
what rate is the population increasing?

**Solution:**

Here we don’t have two points from which we can get x− and y−coordinates for the slope formula. Instead,
                                             ∆y
we’ll need to use the alternate formula, m = ∆x .
The change in y−values, or ∆y, is the change in the number of ﬁsh, which is 420 − 370 = 50. The change
                                                                                         ∆y        ﬁsh
in x−values, ∆x, is the amount of time over which this change took place: two months. So ∆x = 2 50
                                                                                                 months ,
or 25 ﬁsh per month.


Interpret a Graph to Compare Rates of Change

**Example 7**

The graph below represents a trip made by a large delivery truck on a particular day. During the day the
truck made two deliveries, one taking an hour and the other taking two hours. Identify what is happening
at each stage of the trip (stages A through E).


**Solution:**

Here are the stages of the trip:
a) The truck sets oﬀ and travels 80 miles in 2 hours.
b) The truck covers no distance for 2 hours.
c) The truck covers (120 − 80) = 40 miles in 1 hour.
d) The truck covers no distance for 1 hour.
e) The truck covers -120 miles in 2 hours.
Let’s look at each section more closely.
                    ∆y      miles
A. Rate of change = ∆x = 80
                         2 hours = 40 miles per hour
Notice that the rate of change is a speed—or rather, a velocity. (The diﬀerence between the two is that
velocity has a direction, and speed does not. In other words, velocity can be either positive or negative,
with negative velocity representing travel in the opposite direction. You’ll see the diﬀerence more clearly
in part E.)
Since velocity equals distance divided by time, the slope (or rate of change) of a distance-time graph is
always a velocity.
So during the ﬁrst part of the trip, the truck travels at a constant speed of 40 mph for 2 hours, covering a
distance of 80 miles.
B. The slope here is 0, so the rate of change is 0 mph. The truck is stationary for one hour. This is the
ﬁrst delivery stop.
                    ∆y      (120−80) miles
C. Rate of change = ∆x =      (4−3) hours
                                           = 40 miles per hour. The truck is traveling at 40 mph.
D. Once again the slope is 0, so the rate of change is 0 mph. The truck is stationary for two hours. This
is the second delivery stop. At this point the truck is 120 miles from the start position.
                           (0−120) miles
                    ∆y
E. Rate of change = ∆x =    (8−6) hours
                                         = −120 miles
                                            2 hours = −60 miles per hour. The truck is traveling at negative
60 mph.
Wait – a negative speed? Does that mean that the truck is reversing? Well, probably not. It’s actually
the velocity and not the speed that is negative, and a negative velocity simply means that the distance
from the starting position is decreasing with time. The truck is driving in the opposite direction – back to
where it started from. Since it no longer has 2 heavy loads, it travels faster (60 mph instead of 40 mph),
covering the 120 mile return trip in 2 hours. Its speed is 60 mph, and its velocity is -60 mph, because it is
traveling in the opposite direction from when it started out.


Lesson Summary
- Slope is a measure of change in the vertical direction for each step in the horizontal direction. Slope
    is often represented as “m”.
                                        ∆y
- Slope can be expressed as rise
                               run , or ∆x .
- The slope between two points (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ) is equal to yx22 −y
                                                                            −x1 .

- Horizontal lines (where y = a constant) all have a slope of 0.
- Vertical lines (where x = a constant) all have an inﬁnite (or undeﬁned) slope.
- The slope (or rate of change) of a distance-time graph is a velocity.

## 4.5 Graphs Using Slope-Intercept Form


### Learning Objectives

- Identify the slope and y−intercept of equations and graphs.
- Graph an equation in slope-intercept form.
- Understand what happens when you change the slope or intercept of a line.
- Identify parallel lines from their equations.


Introduction
The total proﬁt of a business is described by the equation y = 15000x − 80000, where x is the number of
months the business has been running. How much proﬁt is the business making per month, and what were
its start-up costs? How much proﬁt will it have made in a year?

Identify Slope and y−intercept
So far, we’ve been writing a lot of our equations in slope-intercept form—that is, we’ve been writing
them in the form y = mx + b, where m and b are both constants. It just so happens that m is the slope
and the point (0, b) is the y−intercept of the graph of the equation, which gives us enough information to
draw the graph quickly.

**Example 1**

Identify the slope and y−intercept of the following equations.
a) y = 3x + 2
b) y = 0.5x − 3
c) y = −7x
d) y = −4

**Solution:**

a) Comparing                                , we can see that m = 3 and b = 2. So y = 3x + 2 has a slope


of 3 and a y−intercept of (0, 2).
b)                has a slope of 0.5 and a y−intercept of (0, -3).


Notice that the intercept is negative. The b−term includes the sign of the operator (plus or minus) in
front of the number—for example, y = 0.5x − 3 is identical to y = 0.5x + (−3), and that means that b is -3,
not just 3.
c) At ﬁrst glance, this equation doesn’t look like it’s in slope-intercept form. But we can rewrite it as
y = −7x + 0, and that means it has a slope of -7 and a y−intercept of (0, 0). Notice that the slope is
negative and the line passes through the origin.
d) We can rewrite this one as y = 0x − 4, giving us a slope of 0 and a y−intercept of (0, -4). This is a
horizontal line.

**Example 2**

Identify the slope and y−intercept of the lines on the graph shown below.


The intercepts have been marked, as well as some convenient lattice points that the lines pass through.

**Solution:**

                                                                                   ∆y
a) The y−intercept is (0, 5). The line also passes through (2, 3), so the slope is ∆x = −2
                                                                                         2 = −1.
                                                                                   ∆y
b) The y−intercept is (0, 2). The line also passes through (1, 5), so the slope is ∆x = 31 = 3.
                                                                                    ∆y
c) The y−intercept is (0, -1). The line also passes through (2, 3), so the slope is ∆x = 42 = 2.
                                                                                     ∆y
d) The y−intercept is (0, -3). The line also passes through (4, -4), so the slope is ∆x = −1
                                                                                           4 = − 4 or

-0.25.


Graph an Equation in Slope-Intercept Form
Once we know the slope and intercept of a line, it’s easy to graph it. Just remember what slope means.
Let’s look back at this example from Lesson 4.1.
Ali is trying to work out a trick that his friend showed him. His friend started by asking him to think of a
number, then double it, then add ﬁve to the result. Ali has written down a rule to describe the ﬁrst part of
the trick. He is using the letter x to stand for the number he thought of and the letter y to represent the
ﬁnal result of applying the rule. He wrote his rule in the form of an equation: y = 2x + 5.
Help him visualize what is going on by graphing the function that this rule describes.
In that example, we constructed a table of values, and used that table to plot some points to create our
graph.


We also saw another way to graph this equation. Just by looking at the equation, we could see that the
y−intercept was (0, 5), so we could start by plotting that point. Then we could also see that the slope was
2, so we could ﬁnd another point on the graph by going over 1 unit and up 2 units. The graph would then
be the line between those two points.


Here’s another problem where we can use the same method.

**Example 3**

Graph the following function: y = −3x + 5

**Solution:**

To graph the function without making a table, follow these steps:


     1. Identify the y−intercept: b = 5
     2. Plot the intercept: (0, 5)
     3. Identify the slope: m = −3. (This is equal to −3
                                                       1 , so the rise is -3 and the run is 1.)
     4. Move over 1 unit and down 3 units to ﬁnd another point on the line: (1, 2)
     5. Draw the line through the points (0, 5) and (1, 2).


Notice that to graph this equation based on its slope, we had to ﬁnd the rise and run—and it was easiest
to do that when the slope was expressed as a fraction. That’s true in general: to graph a line with a
particular slope, it’s easiest to ﬁrst express the slope as a fraction in simplest form, and then read oﬀ the
numerator and the denominator of the fraction to get the rise and run of the graph.

**Example 4**

Find integer values for the rise and run of the following slopes, then graph lines with corresponding slopes.
a) m = 3
b) m = −2
c) m = 0.75
d) m = −0.375

**Solution:**

a)


b)


c)


d)


Changing the Slope or Intercept of a Line
The following graph shows a number of lines with diﬀerent slopes, but all with the same y−intercept: (0,
3).

You can see that all the functions with positive slopes increase as we move from left to right, while all
functions with negative slopes decrease as we move from left to right. Another thing to notice is that the
greater the slope, the steeper the graph.
This graph shows a number of lines with the same slope, but diﬀerent y−intercepts.


Notice that changing the intercept simply translates (shifts) the graph up or down. Take a point on the
graph of y = 2x, such as (1, 2). The corresponding point on y = 2x + 3 would be (1, 5). Adding 3 to the
y−intercept means we also add 3 to every other y−value on the graph. Similarly, the corresponding point
on the y = 2x − 3 line would be (1, -1); we would subtract 3 from the y−value and from every other y−value.
Notice also that these lines all appear to be parallel. Are they truly parallel?
To answer that question, we’ll use a technique that you’ll learn more about in a later chapter. We’ll
take 2 of the equations—say, y = 2x and y = 2x + 3—and solve for values of x and y that satisfy both
equations. That will tell us at what point those two lines intersect, if any. (Remember that parallel lines,
by deﬁnition, are lines that don’t intersect.)
So what values would satisfy both y = 2x and y = 2x + 3? Well, if both of those equations were true, then
y would be equal to both 2x and 2x + 3, which means those two expressions would also be equal to each
other. So we can get our answer by solving the equation 2x = 2x + 3.
But what happens when we try to solve that equation? If we subtract 2x from both sides, we end up with
0 = 3. That can’t be true no matter what x equals. And that means that there just isn’t any value for x
that will make both of the equations we started out with true. In other words, there isn’t any point where
those two lines intersect. They are parallel, just as we thought.
And we’d ﬁnd out the same thing no matter which two lines we’d chosen. In general, since changing the
intercept of a line just results in shifting the graph up or down, the new line will always be parallel to the
old line as long as the slope stays the same.


Any two lines with identical slopes are parallel.

Lesson Summary
- A common form of a line (linear equation) is slope-intercept form: y = mx + b, where m is the
    slope and the point (0, b) is the y−intercept
- Graphing a line in slope-intercept form is a matter of ﬁrst plotting the y−intercept (0, b), then ﬁnding
    a second point based on the slope, and using those two points to graph the line.
- Any two lines with identical slopes are parallel.

## 4.6 Direct Variation Models


### Learning Objectives

- Identify direct variation.
- Graph direct variation equations.
- Solve real-world problems using direct variation models.


Introduction
Suppose you see someone buy ﬁve pounds of strawberries at the grocery store. The clerk weighs the
strawberries and charges $12.50 for them. Now suppose you wanted two pounds of strawberries for yourself.
How much would you expect to pay for them?


Identify Direct Variation
The preceding problem is an example of a direct variation. We would expect that the strawberries are
priced on a “per pound” basis, and that if you buy two-ﬁfths the amount of strawberries, you would pay
two-ﬁfths of $12.50 for your strawberries, or $5.00.
Similarly, if you bought 10 pounds of strawberries (twice the amount) you would pay twice $12.50, and if
you did not buy any strawberries you would pay nothing.
If variable y varies directly with variable x, then we write the relationship as y = k · x. k is called the
constant of proportionality.
If we were to graph this function, you can see that it would pass through the origin, because y = 0 when
x = 0,whatever the value of k. So we know that a direct variation, when graphed, has a single intercept at
(0, 0).


**Example 1**

If y varies directly with x according to the relationship y = k · x, and y = 7.5 when x = 2.5, determine the
constant of proportionality, k.

**Solution:**

We can solve for the constant of proportionality using substitution. Substitute x = 2.5 and y = 7.5 into
the equation y = k · x to get 7.5 = k(2.5). Then divide both sides by 2.5 to get k = 7.5
                                                                                     2.5 = 3. The constant
of proportionality, k, is 3.
We can graph the relationship quickly, using the intercept (0, 0) and the point (2.5, 7.5). The graph is
shown below. It is a straight line with slope 3.


The graph of a direct variation always passes through the origin, and always has a slope that is equal to
the constant of proportionality, k.

**Example 2**

The volume of water in a ﬁsh-tank, V, varies directly with depth, d. If there are 15 gallons in the tank
when the depth is 8 inches, calculate how much water is in the tank when the depth is 20 inches.

**Solution:**

This is a good example of a direct variation, but for this problem we’ll have to determine the equation
of the variation ourselves. Since the volume, V, depends on depth, d, we’ll use an equation of the form
y = k · x, but in place of y we’ll use V and in place of x we’ll use d:

                                                 V =k·d

We know that when the depth is 8 inches the volume is 15 gallons, so to solve for k, we plug in 15 for V
and 8 for d to get 15 = k(8). Dividing by 8 gives us k = 15
                                                          8 = 1.875.
Now to ﬁnd the volume of water at the ﬁnal depth, we use V = k · d again, but this time we can plug in
our new d and the value we found for k:

                                              V = 1.875 × 20
                                              V = 37.5

At a depth of 20 inches, the volume of water in the tank is 37.5 gallons.

**Example 3**

The graph shown below is a conversion chart used to convert U.S. dollars (US$) to British pounds (GB£)
in a bank on a particular day. Use the chart to determine:

a) the number of pounds you could buy for $600
b) the number of dollars it would cost to buy £200
c) the exchange rate in pounds per dollar


**Solution:**

We can read the answers to a) and b) right oﬀ the graph. It looks as if at x = 600 the graph is about one
ﬁfth of the way between £350 and £400. So $600 would buy £360.
Similarly, the line y = 200 appears to intersect the graph about a third of the way between $300 and $400.
We can round this to $330, so it would cost approximately $330 to buy £200.
To solve for the exchange rate, we should note that as this is a direct variation - the graph is a straight
line passing through the origin. The slope of the line gives the constant of proportionality (in this case the
exchange rate) and it is equal to the ratio of the y−value to x−value at any point. Looking closely at the
graph, we can see that the line passes through one convenient lattice point: (500, 300). This will give us
the most accurate value for the slope and so the exchange rate.


                                y                    300 pounds
                 y = k · x ⇒=        And so rate =               = 0.60 pounds per dollar
                                x                    500 dollors


Graph Direct Variation Equations
We know that all direct variation graphs pass through the origin, and also that the slope of the line is equal
to the constant of proportionality, k. Graphing is a simple matter of using the point-slope or point-point
methods discussed earlier in this chapter.

**Example 4**

Plot the following direct variations on the same graph.
a) y = 3x
b) y = −2x
c) y = −0.2x
d) y = 92 x

**Solution:**


a) The line passes through (0, 0), as will all these functions. This function has a slope of 3. When we move
across by one unit, the function increases by three units.
b) The line has a slope of -2. When we move across the graph by one unit, the function falls by two units.
c) The line has a slope of -0.2. As a fraction this is equal to − 15 . When we move across by ﬁve units, the
function falls by one unit.
d) The line passes through (0, 0) and has a slope of 29 . When we move across the graph by 9 units, the
function increases by two units.
For more examples of how to plot and identify direct variation functions, see the video at http://
neaportal.k12.ar.us/index.php/2010/06/slope-and-direct-variation/.


Solve Real-World Problems Using Direct Variation Models
Direct variations are seen everywhere in everyday life. Any time one quantity increases at the same rate
another quantity increases (for example, doubling when it doubles and tripling when it triples), we say
that they follow a direct variation.
Newton’s Second Law
In 1687 Sir Isaac Newton published the famous Principia Mathematica. It contained, among other things,
his second law of motion. This law is often written as F = m · a, where a force of F Newtons applied to a
mass of m kilograms results in acceleration of a meters per second2 . Notice that if the mass stays constant,
then this formula is basically the same as the direct variation equation, just with diﬀerent variables—and
m is the constant of proportionality.

**Example 5**

If a 175 Newton force causes a shopping cart to accelerate down the aisle with an acceleration of 2.5 m/s2 ,
calculate:
a) The mass of the shopping cart.
b) The force needed to accelerate the same cart at 6 m/s2 .

**Solution:**

a) We can solve for m (the mass) by plugging in our given values for force and acceleration. F = m · a
becomes 175 = m(2.5), and then we divide both sides by 2.5 to get 70 = m.
So the mass of the shopping cart is 70 kg.
b) Once we have solved for the mass, we simply substitute that value, plus our required acceleration, back
into the formula F = m · a and solve for F. We get F = 70 × 6 = 420.

So the force needed to accelerate the cart at 6 m/s2 is 420 Newtons.


Ohm’s Law

The electrical current, I (amps), passing through an electronic component varies directly with the applied
voltage, V (volts), according to the relationship V = I · R, where R is the resistance (measured in Ohms).
The resistance is considered to be a constant for all values of V and I, so once again, this formula is a
version of the direct variation formula, with R as the constant of proportionality.

**Example 6**

A certain electronics component was found to pass a current of 1.3 amps at a voltage of 2.6 volts. When
the voltage was increased to 12.0 volts the current was found to be 6.0 amps.
a) Does the component obey Ohm’s law?
b) What would the current be at 6 volts?

**Solution:**

Ohm’s law is a simple direct proportionality law, with the resistance R as our constant of proportionality.
To know if this component obeys Ohm’s law, we need to know if it follows a direct proportionality rule.
In other words, is V directly proportional to I?
We can determine this in two diﬀerent ways.
Graph It: If we plot our two points on a graph and join them with a line, does the line pass through (0,
0)?
Voltage is the independent variable and current is the dependent variable, so normally we would graph V
on the horizontal axis and I on the vertical axis. However, if we swap the variables around just this once,
we’ll get a graph whose slope conveniently happens to be equal to the resistance, R. So we’ll treat I as the
independent variable, and our two points will be (1.3, 2.6) and (6, 12).
Plotting those points and joining them gives the following graph:


The graph does appear to pass through the origin, so yes, the component obeys Ohm’s law.
Solve for R: If this component does obey Ohm’s law, the constant of proportionality (R) should be the
same when we plug in the second set of values as when we plug in the ﬁrst set. Let’s see if it is. (We can
quickly ﬁnd the value of R in each case; since V = I · R, that means R = VI .)

                                                V   2.6
                                     Case 1: R =  =     = 2 Ohms
                                                I   1.3
                                                V   12
                                     Case 2: R = =      = 2 Ohms
                                                I    6

The values for R agree! This means that we are indeed looking at a direct variation. The component
obeys Ohm’s law.
b) Now to ﬁnd the current at 6 volts, simply substitute the values for V and R into V = I · R. We found
that R = 2, so we plug in 2 for R and 6 for V to get 6 = I(2), and divide both sides by 2 to get 3 = I.
So the current through the component at a voltage of 6 volts is 3 amps.


Lesson Summary
- If a variable y varies directly with variable x, then we write the relationship as y = k · x, where k is a
    constant called the constant of proportionality.
- Direct variation is very common in many areas of science.

- Analyze arithmetic progressions.


Introduction
The highly exclusive Fellowship of the Green Mantle allows in only a limited number of new members a
year. In its third year of membership it has 28 members, in its fourth year it has 33, and in its ﬁfth year
it has 38. How many members are admitted a year, and how many founding members were there?


Functions
So far we’ve used the term function to describe many of the equations we’ve been graphing, but in
mathematics it’s important to remember that not all equations are functions. In order to be a function, a
relationship between two variables, x and y, must map each x−value to exactly one y−value.
Visually this means the graph of y versus x must pass the vertical line test, meaning that a vertical line
drawn through the graph of the function must never intersect the graph in more than one place:

Use Function Notation
When we write functions we often use the notation “ f (x) =” in place of “y =”. f (x) is pronounced “ f of
x”.

**Example 1**

Rewrite the following equations so that y is a function of x and is written f (x):
a) y = 2x + 5
b) y = −0.2x + 7
c) x = 4y − 5
d) 9x + 3y = 6

**Solution:**

a) Simply replace y with f (x) : f (x) = 2x + 5
b) Again, replace y with f (x) : f (x) = −0.2x + 7
c) First we need to solve for y. Starting with x = 4y − 5, we add 5 to both sides to get x + 5 = 4y, divide
by 4 to get x+5                                             x+5
             4 = y, and then replace y with f (x) : f (x) = 4 .
d) Solve for y : take 9x + 3y = 6, subtract 9x from both sides to get 3y = 6 − 9x, divide by 3 to get
     3 = 2 − 3x, and express as a function: f (x) = 2 − 3x.
y = 6−9x
Using the functional notation in an equation gives us more information. For instance, the expression
f (x) = mx + b shows clearly that x is the independent variable because you plug in values of x into
the function and perform a series of operations on the value of x in order to calculate the values of the
dependent variable, y.
We can also plug in expressions rather than just numbers. For example, if our function is f (x) = x + 2, we
can plug in the expression (x + 5). We would express this as f (x + 5) = (x + 5) + 2 = x + 7.

**Example 2**

A function is deﬁned as f (x) = 6x − 36. Evaluate the following:
a) f (2)
b) f (0)
c) f (z)
d) f (x + 3)
e) f (2r − 1)

**Solution:**

a) Substitute x = 2 into the function f (x) : f (2) = 6 · 2 − 36 = 12 − 36 = −24
b) Substitute x = 0 into the function f (x) : f (0) = 6 · 0 − 36 = 0 − 36 = −36

c) Substitute x = z into the function f (x) : f (z) = 6z + 36
d) Substitute x = (x + 3) into the function f (x) : f (x + 3) = 6(x + 3) + 36 = 6x + 18 + 36 = 6x + 54
e) Substitute x = (2r + 1) into the function f (x) : f (2r + 1) = 6(2r + 1) + 36 = 12r + 6 + 36 = 12r + 42


Graph a Linear Function

Since the notations “ f (x) =” and “y =” are interchangeable, we can use all the concepts we have learned
so far to graph functions.

**Example 3**

Graph the function f (x) = 3x+5
                             4 .

**Solution:**

We can write this function in slope-intercept form:


                                                  3    5
                                        f (x) =     x + = 0.75x + 1.25
                                                  4    4


So our graph will have a y−intercept of (0, 1.25) and a slope of 0.75.


**Example 4**

                             7(5−x)
Graph the function f (x) =      5 .

**Solution:**

This time we’ll solve for the x− and y−intercepts.
                                                        7(5−0)
To solve for the y−intercept, plug in x = 0 : f (0) =      5   = 35
                                                                  5 = 7, so the x−intercept is (0, 7).
                                                    7(5−x)
To solve for the x−intercept, set f (x) = 0 : 0 =      5 , so 0 = 35 − 7x, therefore 7x = 35 and x = 5.   The
y−intercept is (5, 0).
We can graph the function from those two points:

Arithmetic Progressions
You may have noticed that with linear functions, when you increase the x−value by 1 unit, the y−value
increases by a ﬁxed amount, equal to the slope. For example, if we were to make a table of values for the
function f (x) = 2x + 3, we might start at x = 0 and then add 1 to x for each row:

                                               Table 4.6:

 x                                                    f (x)
 0                                                    3
 1                                                    5
 2                                                    7
 3                                                    9
 4                                                    11


Notice that the values for f (x) go up by 2 (the slope) each time. When we repeatedly add a ﬁxed value
to a starting number, we get a sequence like {3, 5, 7, 9, 11....}. We call this an arithmetic progression,
and it is characterized by the fact that each number is bigger (or smaller) than the preceding number by
a ﬁxed amount. This amount is called the common diﬀerence. We can ﬁnd the common diﬀerence for
a given sequence by taking 2 consecutive terms in the sequence and subtracting the ﬁrst from the second.

**Example 5**

Find the common diﬀerence for the following arithmetic progressions:
a) {7, 11, 15, 19, ...}
b) {12, 1, -10, -21, ...}
c) {7, __, 12, __, 17, ...}

**Solution:**

a) 11 − 7 = 4; 15 − 11 = 4; 19 − 15 = 4. The common diﬀerence is 4.
b) 1 − 12 = −11. The common diﬀerence is -11.
c) There are not 2 consecutive terms here, but we know that to get the term after 7 we would add the
common diﬀerence, and then to get to 12 we would add the common diﬀerence again. So twice the common
diﬀerence is 12 − 7 = 5, and so the common diﬀerence is 2.5.

Arithmetic sequences and linear functions are very closely related. To get to the next term in a arithmetic
sequence, you add the common diﬀerence to the last term; similarly, when the x−value of a linear function
increases by one, the y−value increases by the amount of the slope. So arithmetic sequences are very much
like linear functions, with the common diﬀerence playing the same role as the slope.
The graph below shows the arithmetic progression {-2, 0, 2, 4, 6...} along with the function y = 2x − 4.
The only major diﬀerence between the two graphs is that an arithmetic sequence is discrete while a linear
function is continuous.
We can write a formula for an arithmetic progression: if we deﬁne the ﬁrst term as a1 and d as the common
diﬀerence, then the other terms are as follows:

                 a1       a2          a3         a4          a5                    an
                 a1     a1 + d     a1 + 2d     a1 + 3d     a1 + 4d   ...   a1 + (n − 1) · d

The online calculator at http://planetcalc.com/177/ will tell you the nth term in an arithmetic pro-
gression if you tell it the ﬁrst term, the common diﬀerence, and what value to use for n (in other words,
which term in the sequence you want to know). It will also tell you the sum of all the terms up to that
point. Finding sums of sequences is something you will learn to do in future math classes.


Lesson Summary
- In order for an equation to be a function, the relationship between the two variables, x and y, must
    map each x−value to exactly one y−value.

Introduction
In this chapter, we’ve been solving problems where quantities are linearly related to each other. In this
section, we’ll look at a few examples of linear relationships that occur in real-world problems, and see how
we can solve them using graphs. Remember back to our Problem Solving Plan:


  1. Understand the Problem
  2. Devise a Plan—Translate
  3. Carry Out the Plan—Solve
  4. Look—Check and Interpret


**Example 1**

A cell phone company is oﬀering its costumers the following deal: You can buy a new cell phone for $60
and pay a monthly ﬂat rate of $40 per month for unlimited calls. How much money will this deal cost you
after 9 months?

**Solution:**

Let’s follow the problem solving plan.
Step 1: The phone costs $60; the calling plan costs $40 per month.
Let x = number of months.
Let y = total cost.
Step 2: We can solve this problem by making a graph that shows the number of months on the horizontal
axis and the cost on the vertical axis.
Since you pay $60 when you get the phone, the y−intercept is (0, 60).
You pay $40 for each month, so the cost rises by $40 for 1 month, so the slope is 40.
We can graph this line using the slope-intercept method.

Step 3: The question was “How much will this deal cost after 9 months?” We can now read the answer
from the graph. We draw a vertical line from 9 months until it meets the graph, and then draw a horizontal
line until it meets the vertical axis.


We see that after 9 months you pay approximately $420.
Step 4: To check if this is correct, let’s think of the deal again.
Originally, you pay $60 and then $40 a month for 9 months.


                                             Phone = $60
                                       Calling plan = $40 × 9 = $360
                                         Total cost = $420.


The answer checks out.

**Example 2**

A stretched spring has a length of 12 inches when a weight of 2 lbs is attached to the spring. The same
spring has a length of 18 inches when a weight of 5 lbs is attached to the spring. What is the length of the
spring when no weights are attached?


**Solution:**

Step 1: We know: the length of the spring = 12 inches when weight = 2 lbs
the length of the spring = 18 inches when weight = 5 lbs
We want: the length of the spring when weight = 0 lbs
Let x = the weight attached to the spring.
Let y = the length of the spring.
Step 2: We can solve this problem by making a graph that shows the weight on the horizontal axis and
the length of the spring on the vertical axis.
We have two points we can graph:
When the weight is 2 lbs, the length of the spring is 12 inches. This gives point (2, 12).
When the weight is 5 lbs, the length of the spring is 18 inches. This gives point (5, 18).
Graphing those two points and connecting them gives us our line.


Step 3: The question was: “What is the length of the spring when no weights are attached?
We can answer this question by reading the graph we just made. When there is no weight on the spring, the
x−value equals zero, so we are just looking for the y−intercept of the graph. On the graph, the y−intercept
appears to be approximately 8 inches.
Step 4: To check if this correct, let’s think of the problem again.
You can see that the length of the spring goes up by 6 inches when the weight is increased by 3 lbs, so the
slope of the line is 6 3inches
                          lbs = 2 inches/lb.


To ﬁnd the length of the spring when there is no weight attached, we can look at the spring when there
are 2 lbs attached. For each pound we take oﬀ, the spring will shorten by 2 inches. If we take oﬀ 2 lbs,
the spring will be shorter by 4 inches. So, the length of the spring with no weights is 12 inches - 4 inches
= 8 inches.
The answer checks out.

**Example 3**

Christine took 1 hour to read 22 pages of Harry Potter. She has 100 pages left to read in order to ﬁnish
the book. How much time should she expect to spend reading in order to ﬁnish the book?

**Solution:**

Step 1: We know - Christine takes 1 hour to read 22 pages.
We want - How much time it takes to read 100 pages.
Let x = the time expressed in hours.
Let y = the number of pages.
Step 2: We can solve this problem by making a graph that shows the number of hours spent reading on
the horizontal axis and the number of pages on the vertical axis.
We have two points we can graph:
Christine takes 1 hour to read 22 pages. This gives point (1, 22).
A second point is not given, but we know that Christine would take 0 hours to read 0 pages. This gives
point (0, 0).
Graphing those two points and connecting them gives us our line.


Step 3: The question was: “How much time should Christine expect to spend reading 100 pages?” We can
ﬁnd the answer from reading the graph - we draw a horizontal line from 100 pages until it meets the graph
and then we draw the vertical until it meets the horizontal axis. We see that it takes approximately 4.5
hours to read the remaining 100 pages.
Step 4: To check if this correct, let’s think of the problem again.
We know that Christine reads 22 pages per hour - this is the slope of the line or the rate at which she is
reading. To ﬁnd how many hours it takes her to read 100 pages, we divide the number of pages by the rate.
In this case, 22100 pages
                 pages/hour
                            = 4.54 hours. This is very close to the answer we got from reading the graph.
The answer checks out.

**Example 4**


Aatif wants to buy a surfboard that costs $249. He was given a birthday present of $50 and he has a summer
job that pays him $6.50 per hour. To be able to buy the surfboard, how many hours does he need to work?

**Solution:**

Step 1: We know - The surfboard costs $249.
Aatif has $50.
His job pays $6.50 per hour.
We want - How many hours Aatif needs to work to buy the surfboard.
Let x = the time expressed in hours
Let y = Aatif’s earnings
Step 2: We can solve this problem by making a graph that shows the number of hours spent working on
the horizontal axis and Aatif’s earnings on the vertical axis.
Aatif has $50 at the beginning. This is the y−intercept: (0, 50).
He earns $6.50 per hour. This is the slope of the line.
We can graph this line using the slope-intercept method. We graph the y−intercept of (0, 50), and we know
that for each unit in the horizontal direction, the line rises by 6.5 units in the vertical direction. Here is
the line that describes this situation.


Step 3: The question was: “How many hours does Aatif need to work to buy the surfboard?”
We ﬁnd the answer from reading the graph - since the surfboard costs $249, we draw a horizontal line
from $249 on the vertical axis until it meets the graph and then we draw a vertical line downwards until
it meets the horizontal axis. We see that it takes approximately 31 hours to earn the money.
Step 4: To check if this correct, let’s think of the problem again.
We know that Aatif has $50 and needs $249 to buy the surfboard. So, he needs to earn $249 − $50 = $199
from his job.
                                                                                 $199
His job pays $6.50 per hour. To ﬁnd how many hours he need to work we divide: $6.50/hour = 30.6 hours.
This is very close to the answer we got from reading the graph.
The answer checks out.

Introduction

We saw in the last chapter that many real-world situations can be described with linear graphs and
equations. In this chapter, we’ll see how to ﬁnd those equations in a variety of situations.


Write an Equation Given Slope and y−Intercept

You’ve already learned how to write an equation in slope–intercept form: simply start with the general
equation for the slope-intercept form of a line, y = mx + b, and then plug the given values of m and b
into the equation. For example, a line with a slope of 4 and a y−intercept of -3 would have the equation
y = 4x − 3.
If you are given just the graph of a line, you can read oﬀ the slope and y−intercept from the graph and
write the equation from there. For example, on the graph below you can see that the line rises by 1 unit as
it moves 2 units to the right, so its slope is 12 . Also, you can see that the y−intercept is -2, so the equation
of the line is y = 12 x − 2.

Write an Equation Given the Slope and a Point
Often, we don’t know the value of the y−intercept, but we know the value of y for a non-zero value of
x. In this case, it’s often easier to write an equation of the line in point-slope form. An equation in
point-slope form is written as y − y0 = m(x − x0 ), where m is the slope and (x0 , y0 ) is a point on the line.

**Example 1**

A line has a slope of 53 , and the point (2, 6) is on the line. Write the equation of the line in point-slope
form.

**Solution:**

Start with the formula y − y0 = m(x − x0 ).
Plug in 53 for m, 2 for x0 and 6 for y0 .
The equation in point-slope form is y − 6 = 35 (x − 2).
Notice that the equation in point-slope form is not solved for y. If we did solve it for y, we’d have it in
y−intercept form. To do that, we would just need to distribute the 35 and add 6 to both sides. That means
that the equation of this line in slope-intercept form is y = 35 x − 56 + 6, or simply y = 53 x + 24
                                                                                                   5 .


Write an Equation Given Two Points
Point-slope form also comes in useful when we need to ﬁnd an equation given just two points on a line.
For example, suppose we are told that the line passes through the points (-2, 3) and (5, 2). To ﬁnd the
equation of the line, we can start by ﬁnding the slope.
Starting with the slope formula, m = yx22 −y
                                          −x1 , we plug in the x− and y−values of the two points to get

      2−3
m = 5−(−2) = −1
              7 . We can plug that value of m into the point-slope formula to get y − y0 = − 7 (x − x0 ).


Now we just need to pick one of the two points to plug into the formula. Let’s use (5, 2); that gives us
y − 2 = − 71 (x − 5).
What if we’d picked the other point instead? Then we’d have ended up with the equation y − 3 = − 17 (x + 2),
which doesn’t look the same. That’s because there’s more than one way to write an equation for a given
line in point-slope form. But let’s see what happens if we solve each of those equations for y.
Starting with y−2 = − 71 (x−5), we distribute the − 17 and add 2 to both sides. That gives us y = − 17 x+ 57 +2,

or y = − 17 x + 19
                 7 .
On the other hand, if we start with y − 3 = − 17 (x + 2), we need to distribute the − 17 and add 3 to both
sides. That gives us y = − 17 x − 27 + 3, which also simpliﬁes to y = − 17 x + 19
                                                                                7 .
So whichever point we choose to get an equation in point-slope form, the equation is still mathematically
the same, and we can see this when we convert it to y−intercept form.

**Example 2**

A line contains the points (3, 2) and (-2, 4). Write an equation for the line in point-slope form; then write
an equation in y−intercept form.

**Solution:**

Find the slope of the line: m = yx22 −y
                                     −x1 = −2−3 = − 5
                                        1  4−2      2


Plug in the value of the slope: y − y0 = − 25 (x − x0 ).
Plug point (3, 2) into the equation: y − 2 = − 25 (x − 3).
The equation in point-slope form is y − 2 = − 25 (x − 3).
To convert to y−intercept form, simply solve for y:


                                2                   2   6       2   6       2   4
                       y − 2 = − (x − 3) → y − 2 = − x − → y = − x − + 2 = − x + .
                                5                   5   5       5   5       5   5


The equation in y−intercept form is y = − 25 x + 45 .


Graph an Equation in Point-Slope Form

Another useful thing about point-slope form is that you can use it to graph an equation without having
to convert it to slope-intercept form. From the equation y − y0 = m(x − x0 ), you can just read oﬀ the slope
m and the point (x0 , y0 ). To draw the graph, all you have to do is plot the point, and then use the slope
to ﬁgure out how many units up and over you should move to ﬁnd another point on the line.

**Example 5**

Make a graph of the line given by the equation y + 2 = 23 (x − 2).

**Solution:**

To read oﬀ the right values, we need to rewrite the equation slightly: y − (−2) = 32 (x − 2). Now we see that
point (2, -2) is on the line and that the slope is 23 .
First plot point (2, -2) on the graph:

A slope of 23 tells you that from that point you should move 2 units up and 3 units to the right and draw
another point:


Now draw a line through the two points and extend it in both directions:


Linear Equations in Standard Form
You’ve already encountered another useful form for writing linear equations: standard form. An equation
in standard form is written ax + by = c, where a, b, and c are all integers and a is positive. (Note that the
b in the standard form is diﬀerent than the b in the slope-intercept form.)
One useful thing about standard form is that it allows us to write equations for vertical lines, which we
can’t do in slope-intercept form.
For example, let’s look at the line that passes through points (2, 6) and (2, 9). How would we ﬁnd an
equation for that line in slope-intercept form?
First we’d need to ﬁnd the slope: m = 9−6      3
                                        0−0 = 0 . But that slope is undeﬁned because we can’t divide by
zero. And if we can’t ﬁnd the slope, we can’t use point-slope form either.
If we just graph the line, we can see that x equals 2 no matter what y is. There’s no way to express that in
slope-intercept or point-slope form, but in standard form we can just say that x + 0y = 2, or simply x = 2.


Converting to Standard Form
To convert an equation from another form to standard form, all you need to do is rewrite the equation so
that all the variables are on one side of the equation and the coeﬀicient of x is not negative.

**Example 1**

Rewrite the following equations in standard form:
a) y = 5x − 7
b) y − 2 = −3(x + 3)
c) y = 32 x + 12

**Solution:**

We need to rewrite each equation so that all the variables are on one side and the coeﬀicient of x is not
negative.
a) y = 5x − 7
Subtract y from both sides to get 0 = 5x − y − 7.
Add 7 to both sides to get 7 = 5x − y.
Flip the equation around to put it in standard form: 5x − y = 7.
b) y − 2 = −3(x + 3)
Distribute the –3 on the right-hand-side to get y − 2 = −3x − 9.
Add 3x to both sides to get y + 3x − 2 = −9.
Add 2 to both sides to get y + 3x = −7. Flip that around to get 3x + y = −7.
c) y = 32 x + 12
Find the common denominator for all terms in the equation – in this case that would be 6.
                                          (             )
Multiply all terms in the equation by 6: 6 y = 23 x + 12 ⇒ 6y = 4x + 3
Subtract 6y from both sides: 0 = 4x − 6y + 3
Subtract 3 from both sides: −3 = 4x − 6y
The equation in standard form is 4x − 6y = −3.

Graphing Equations in Standard Form


When an equation is in slope-intercept form or point-slope form, you can tell right away what the slope is.
How do you ﬁnd the slope when an equation is in standard form?
Well, you could rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form and read oﬀ the slope. But there’s an even
easier way. Let’s look at what happens when we rewrite an equation in standard form.
Starting with the equation ax + by = c, we would subtract ax from both sides to get by = −ax + c. Then
we would divide all terms by b and end up with y = − ba x + bc .
That means that the slope is − ab and the y−intercept is bc . So next time we look at an equation in standard
form, we don’t have to rewrite it to ﬁnd the slope; we know the slope is just − ba , where a and b are the
coeﬀicients of x and y in the equation.

**Example 2**

Find the slope and the y−intercept of the following equations written in standard form.
a) 3x + 5y = 6
b) 2x − 3y = −8
c) x − 5y = 10

**Solution:**

a) a = 3, b = 5, and c = 6, so the slope is − ab = − 35 , and the y−intercept is bc = 65 .
b) a = 2, b = −3, and c = −8, so the slope is − ab = 23 , and the y−intercept is bc = 83 .
c) a = 1, b = −5, and c = 10, so the slope is − ab = 15 , and the y−intercept is bc = −5
                                                                                         = −2.
Once we’ve found the slope and y−intercept of an equation in standard form, we can graph it easily. But
if we start with a graph, how do we ﬁnd an equation of that line in standard form?
First, remember that we can also use the cover-up method to graph an equation in standard form, by
ﬁnding the intercepts of the line. For example, let’s graph the line given by the equation 3x − 2y = 6.
To ﬁnd the x−intercept, cover up the y term (remember, the x−intercept is where y = 0):


3x = 6 ⇒ x = 2
The x− intercept is (2, 0).
To ﬁnd the y−intercept, cover up the x term (remember, the y−intercept is where x = 0):


−2y = 6 ⇒ y = −3
The y−intercept is (0, -3).
We plot the intercepts and draw a line through them that extends in both directions:

Now we want to apply this process in reverse—to start with the graph of the line and write the equation
of the line in standard form.

**Example 3**

Find the equation of each line and write it in standard form.
a)


b)


c)


**Solution:**

a) We see that the x−intercept is (3, 0) ⇒ x = 3 and the y−intercept is (0, −4) ⇒ y = −4
We saw that in standard form ax + by = c: if we “cover up” the y term, we get ax = c, and if we “cover
up” the x term, we get by = c.
So we need to ﬁnd values for a and b so that we can plug in 3 for x and -4 for y and get the same value for
c in both cases. This is like ﬁnding the least common multiple of the x− and y−intercepts.
In this case, we see that multiplying x = 3 by 4 and multiplying y = −4 by –3 gives the same result:

                        (x = 3) × 4 ⇒ 4x = 12   and   (y = −4) × (−3) ⇒ −3y = 12

Therefore, a = 4, b = −3 and c = 12 and the equation in standard form is 4x − 3y = 12.
b) We see that the x−intercept is (3, 0) ⇒ x = 3 and the y−intercept is (0, 3) ⇒ y = 3
The values of the intercept equations are already the same, so a = 1, b = 1 and c = 3. The equation in
standard form is x + y = 3.
                                  (     )
c) We see that the x−intercept is 23 , 0 ⇒ x = 32 and the y−intercept is (0, 4) ⇒ y = 4
Let’s multiply the x−intercept equation by 2 ⇒ 2x = 3

Then we see we can multiply the x−intercept again by 4 and the y−intercept by 3, so we end up with
8x = 12 and 3y = 12.
The equation in standard form is 8x + 3y = 12.


Solving Real-World Problems Using Linear Models in Point-Slope
Form
Let’s solve some word problems where we need to write the equation of a straight line in point-slope form.

**Example 4**

Marciel rented a moving truck for the day. Marciel only remembers that the rental truck company charges
$40 per day and some number of cents per mile. Marciel drives 46 miles and the ﬁnal amount of the bill
(before tax) is $63. What is the amount per mile the truck rental company charges? Write an equation in
point-slope form that describes this situation. How much would it cost to rent this truck if Marciel drove
220 miles?

**Solution:**

Let’s deﬁne our variables:
x = distance in miles
y = cost of the rental truck
Peter pays a ﬂat fee of $40 for the day; this is the y−intercept.
He pays $63 for 46 miles; this is the coordinate point (46,63).
Start with the point-slope form of the line: y − y0 = m(x − x0 )
Plug in the coordinate point: 63 − y0 = m(46 − x0 )
Plug in the point (0, 40): 63 − 40 = m(46 − 0)
Solve for the slope: 23 = 46m → m = 46
                                       = 0.5
The slope is 0.5 dollars per mile, so the truck company charges 50 cents per mile ($0.5 = 50 cents). Plugging
in the slope and the y−intercept, the equation of the line is y = 0.5x + 40.
To ﬁnd out the cost of driving the truck 220 miles, we plug in x = 220 to get y − 40 = 0.5(220) ⇒ y = $150.
Driving 220 miles would cost $150.

**Example 5**

Anne got a job selling window shades. She receives a monthly base salary and a $6 commission for each
window shade she sells. At the end of the month she adds up sales and she ﬁgures out that she sold 200
window shades and made $2500. Write an equation in point-slope form that describes this situation. How
much is Anne’s monthly base salary?

**Solution:**

Let’s deﬁne our variables:
x = number of window shades sold
y = Anne’s earnings
We see that we are given the slope and a point on the line:
Nadia gets $6 for each shade, so the slope is 6.
She made $2500 when she sold 200 shades, so the point is (200, 2500).

Start with the point-slope form of the line: y − y0 = m(x − x0 )
Plug in the slope: y − y0 = 6(x − x0 )
Plug in the point (200, 2500): y − 2500 = 6(x − 200)
To ﬁnd Anne’s base salary, we plug in x = 0 and get y − 2500 = −1200 ⇒ y = $1300.
Anne’s monthly base salary is $1300.


Solving Real-World Problems Using Linear Models in Standard
Form
Here are two examples of real-world problems where the standard form of an equation is useful.

**Example 6**

Nadia buys fruit at her local farmer’s market. This Saturday, oranges cost $2 per pound and cherries
cost $3 per pound. She has $12 to spend on fruit. Write an equation in standard form that describes this
situation. If she buys 4 pounds of oranges, how many pounds of cherries can she buy?

**Solution:**

Let’s deﬁne our variables:
x = pounds of oranges
y = pounds of cherries
The equation that describes this situation is 2x + 3y = 12.
If she buys 4 pounds of oranges, we can plug x = 4 into the equation and solve for y:

                              2(4) + 3y = 12 ⇒ 3y = 12 − 8 ⇒ 3y = 4 ⇒ y =

Nadia can buy 1 13 pounds of cherries.

**Example 7**

Peter skateboards part of the way to school and walks the rest of the way. He can skateboard at 7 miles per
hour and he can walk at 3 miles per hour. The distance to school is 6 miles. Write an equation in standard
form that describes this situation. If he skateboards for 12 an hour, how long does he need to walk to get to
school?

**Solution:**

Let’s deﬁne our variables:
x = time Peter skateboards
y = time Peter walks
The equation that describes this situation is: 7x + 3y = 6
If Peter skateboards 12 an hour, we can plug x = 0.5 into the equation and solve for y:

                             7(0.5) + 3y = 6 ⇒ 3y = 6 − 3.5 ⇒ 3y = 2.5 ⇒ y =

Peter must walk 65 of an hour.

Further Practice
Now that you’ve worked with equations in all three basic forms, check out the Java applet at http:
//www.ronblond.com/M10/lineAP/index.html. You can use it to manipulate graphs of equations in all
three forms, and see how the graphs change when you vary the terms of the equations.
Another applet at http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Calculus/StraightLine.shtml lets you
create multiple lines and see how they intersect. Each line is deﬁned by two points; you can change the
slope of a line by moving either of the points, or just drag the whole line around without changing its
slope. To create another line, just click Duplicate and then drag one of the lines that are already there.

## 5.2 Equations of Parallel and Perpendicular Lines


### Learning Objectives


- Determine whether lines are parallel or perpendicular
- Write equations of perpendicular lines
- Write equations of parallel lines
- Investigate families of lines

Introduction

In this section you will learn how parallel lines and perpendicular lines are related to each other on
the coordinate plane. Let’s start by looking at a graph of two parallel lines.


We can clearly see that the two lines have diﬀerent y−intercepts: 6 and –4.
                                                           6−2
How about the slopes of the lines? The slope of line A is 0−(−2) = 42 = 2, and the slope of line B is
0−(−4) 4
 2−0 = 2 = 2. The slopes are the same.
Is that signiﬁcant? Yes. By deﬁnition, parallel lines never meet. That means that when one of them slopes
up by a certain amount, the other one has to slope up by the same amount so the lines will stay the same
distance apart. If you look at the graph above, you can see that for any x−value you pick, the y−values of
lines A and B are the same vertical distance apart—which means that both lines go up by the same vertical
distance every time they go across by the same horizontal distance. In order to stay parallel, their slopes
must stay the same.
All parallel lines have the same slopes and diﬀerent y−intercepts.
Now let’s look at a graph of two perpendicular lines.


We can’t really say anything about the y−intercepts. In this example, the y−intercepts are diﬀerent, but if

we moved the lines four units to the right, they would both intercept the y−axis at (0, -2). So perpendicular
lines can have the same or diﬀerent y−intercepts.
What about the relationship between the slopes of the two lines?


To ﬁnd the slope of line A, we pick two points on the line and draw the blue (upper) right triangle. The
legs of the triangle represent the rise and the run. We can see that the slope is 48 , or 2.
To ﬁnd the slope of line B, we pick two points on the line and draw the red (lower) right triangle. Notice
that the two triangles are identical, only rotated by 90◦ . Where line A goes 8 units up and 4 units right,
line B goes 8 units right and 4 units down. Its slope is − 48 , or − 12 .
This is always true for perpendicular lines; where one line goes a units up and b units right, the other line
will go a units right and b units down, so the slope of one line will be ba and the slope of the other line will
be − ba .
The slopes of perpendicular lines are always negative reciprocals of each other.
The Java applet at http://members.shaw.ca/ron.blond/perp.APPLET/index.html lets you drag around
a pair of perpendicular lines to see how their slopes change. Click “Show Grid” to see the x− and y−axes,
and click “Show Constructors” to see the triangles that are being used to calculate the slopes of the lines
(you can then drag the circle to make it bigger or smaller, and click on a triangle to see the slope calculations
in detail.)


Determine When Lines are Parallel or Perpendicular
You can ﬁnd whether lines are parallel or perpendicular by comparing the slopes of the lines. If you are
given points on the lines, you can ﬁnd their slopes using the formula. If you are given the equations of
the lines, re-write each equation in a form that makes it easy to read the slope, such as the slope-intercept
form.

**Example 1**

Determine whether the lines are parallel or perpendicular or neither.
a) One line passes through the points (2, 11) and (-1, 2); another line passes through the points (0, -4)
and (-2, -10).
b) One line passes through the points (-2, -7) and (1, 5); another line passes through the points (4, 1) and
(-8, 4).

c) One lines passes through the points (3, 1) and (-2, -2); another line passes through the points (5, 5) and
(4, -6).

**Solution:**

Find the slope of each line and compare them.
                                           −10−(−4)
        2−11
a) m1 = −1−2 = −9
               −3 = 3       and     m2 =     −2−0   = −6
                                                      −2 = 3
The slopes are equal, so the lines are parallel.
         5−(−7)
b) m1 = 1−(−2) = 12
                 3 =4       and          4−1
                                    m2 = −8−4    3
                                              = −12 = − 14
The slopes are negative reciprocals of each other, so the lines are perpendicular.
c) m1 = −2−1   −3   3
        −2−3 = −5 = 5       and     m2 = −6−5   −13
                                          4−5 = −1 = 13
The slopes are not the same or negative reciprocals of each other, so the lines are neither parallel nor
perpendicular.

**Example 2**

Determine whether the lines are parallel or perpendicular or neither:
a) 3x + 4y = 2 and 8x − 6y = 5
b) 2x = y − 10 and y = −2x + 5
c) 7y + 1 = 7x and x + 5 = y

**Solution:**

Write each equation in slope-intercept form:
a) line 1: 3x + 4y = 2 ⇒ 4y = −3x + 2 ⇒ y = − 34 x + 12 ⇒ slope = − 34
line 2: 8x − 6y = 5 ⇒ 8x − 5 = 6y ⇒ y = 68 x − 56 ⇒ y = 43 x − 65 ⇒ slope = 43
The slopes are negative reciprocals of each other, so the lines are perpendicular.
b) line 1: 2x = y − 10 ⇒ y = 2x + 10 ⇒ slope = 2
line 2: y = −2x + 5 ⇒ slope = −2
The slopes are not the same or negative reciprocals of each other, so the lines are neither parallel nor
perpendicular.
c) line 1: 7y + 1 = 7x ⇒ 7y = 7x − 1 ⇒ y = x − 71 ⇒ slope = 1
line 2: x + 5 = y ⇒ y = x + 5 ⇒ slope = 1
The slopes are the same, so the lines are parallel.


Write Equations of Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
We can use the properties of parallel and perpendicular lines to write an equation of a line parallel or
perpendicular to a given line. You might be given a line and a point, and asked to ﬁnd the line that goes
through the given point and is parallel or perpendicular to the given line. Here’s how to do this:

  1. Find the slope of the given line from its equation. (You might need to re-write the equation in a
     form such as the slope-intercept form.)
  2. Find the slope of the parallel or perpendicular line—which is either the same as the slope you found in
     step 1 (if it’s parallel), or the negative reciprocal of the slope you found in step 1 (if it’s perpendicular).
  3. Use the slope you found in step 2, along with the point you were given, to write an equation of the

      new line in slope-intercept form or point-slope form.


**Example 3**

Find an equation of the line perpendicular to the line y = −3x + 5 that passes through the point (2, 6).

**Solution:**

The slope of the given line is -3, so the perpendicular line will have a slope of 13 .
Now to ﬁnd the equation of a line with slope 13 that passes through (2, 6):
Start with the slope-intercept form: y = mx + b.
Plug in the slope: y = 13 x + b.
Plug in the point (2, 6) to ﬁnd b: 6 = 13 (2) + b ⇒ b = 6 − 23 ⇒ b = 20
                                                                     3 .
The equation of the line is y = 31 x + 20
                                        3 .

**Example 4**

Find the equation of the line perpendicular to x − 5y = 15 that passes through the point (-2, 5).

**Solution:**

Re-write the equation in slope-intercept form: x − 5y = 15 ⇒ −5y = −x + 15 ⇒ y = 51 x − 3.
The slope of the given line is 15 , so we’re looking for a line with slope -5.
Start with the slope-intercept form: y = mx + b.
Plug in the slope: y = −5x + b.
Plug in the point (-2, 5): 5 = −5(−2) + b ⇒ b = 5 − 10 ⇒ b = −5
The equation of the line is y = −5x − 5.

**Example 5**

Find the equation of the line parallel to 6x − 5y = 12 that passes through the point (-5, -3).

**Solution:**

Rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form: 6x − 5y = 12 ⇒ 5y = 6x − 12 ⇒ y = 56 x − 12
                                                                                        5 .
The slope of the given line is 65 , so we are looking for a line with slope 56 that passes through the point (-5,
-3).
Start with the slope-intercept form: y = mx + b.
Plug in the slope: y = 65 x + b.
Plug in the point (-5, -3): n − 3 = 65 (−5) + b ⇒ −3 = −6 + b ⇒ b = 3
The equation of the line is y = 56 x + 3.


Investigate Families of Lines
A family of lines is a set of lines that have something in common with each other. Straight lines can
belong to two types of families: one where the slope is the same and one where the y–intercept is the same.
Family 1: Keep the slope unchanged and vary the y−intercept.
The ﬁgure below shows the family of lines with equations of the form y = −2x + b:

All the lines have a slope of –2, but the value of b is diﬀerent for each line.
Notice that in such a family all the lines are parallel. All the lines look the same, except that they are
shifted up and down the y−axis. As b gets larger the line rises on the y−axis, and as b gets smaller the line
goes lower on the y−axis. This behavior is often called a vertical shift.
Family 2: Keep the y−intercept unchanged and vary the slope.
The ﬁgure below shows the family of lines with equations of the form y = mx + 2:


All the lines have a y−intercept of two, but the slope is diﬀerent for each line. The steeper lines have higher
values of m.

**Example 6**

Write the equation of the family of lines satisfying the given condition.
a) parallel to the x−axis
b) through the point (0, -1)
c) perpendicular to 2x + 7y − 9 = 0
d) parallel to x + 4y − 12 = 0

**Solution:**

a) All lines parallel to the x−axis have a slope of zero; the y−intercept can be anything. So the family of
lines is y = 0x + b or just y = b.


b) All lines passing through the point (0, -1) have the same y−intercept, b = −1. The family of lines is:
y = mx − 1.


c) First we need to ﬁnd the slope of the given line. Rewriting 2x + 7y − 9 = 0 in slope-intercept form, we
get y = − 27 x + 97 . The slope of the line is − 27 , so we’re looking for the family of lines with slope 72 .
The family of lines is y = 27 x + b.


d) Rewrite x + 4y − 12 = 0 in slope-intercept form: y = − 14 x + 3. The slope is − 41 , so that’s also the slope
of the family of lines we are looking for.
The family of lines is y = − 14 x + b.

## 5.3 Fitting a Line to Data


### Learning Objectives

- Make a scatter plot.
- Fit a line to data and write an equation for that line.
- Perform linear regression with a graphing calculator.
- Solve real-world problems using linear models of scattered data.


Introduction
Katja has noticed that sales are falling oﬀ at her store lately. She plots her sales ﬁgures for each week on
a graph and sees that the points are trending downward, but they don’t quite make a straight line. How
can she predict what her sales ﬁgures will be over the next few weeks?

In real-world problems, the relationship between our dependent and independent variables is linear, but
not perfectly so. We may have a number of data points that don’t quite ﬁt on a straight line, but we
may still want to ﬁnd an equation representing those points. In this lesson, we’ll learn how to ﬁnd linear
equations to ﬁt real-world data.


Make a Scatter Plot

A scatter plot is a plot of all the ordered pairs in a table. Even when we expect the relationship we’re
analyzing to be linear, we usually can’t expect that all the points will ﬁt perfectly on a straight line.
Instead, the points will be “scattered” about a straight line.
There are many reasons why the data might not fall perfectly on a line. Small errors in measurement are
one reason; another reason is that the real world isn’t always as simple as a mathematical abstraction, and
sometimes math can only describe it approximately.

**Example 1**

Make a scatter plot of the following ordered pairs:
(0, 2); (1, 4.5); (2, 9); (3, 11); (4, 13); (5, 18); (6, 19.5)

**Solution:**

We make a scatter plot by graphing all the ordered pairs on the coordinate axis:


Fit a Line to Data

Notice that the points look like they might be part of a straight line, although they wouldn’t ﬁt perfectly
on a straight line. If the points were perfectly lined up, we could just draw a line through any two of
them, and that line would go right through all the other points as well. When the points aren’t lined up
perfectly, we just have to ﬁnd a line that is as close to all the points as possible.

Here you can see that we could draw many lines through the points in our data set. However, the red line
A is the line that best ﬁts the points. To prove this mathematically, we would measure all the distances
from each data point to line A: and then we would show that the sum of all those distances—or rather,
the square root of the sum of the squares of the distances—is less than it would be for any other line.


Actually proving this is a lesson for a much more advanced course, so we won’t do it here. And ﬁnding
the best ﬁt line in the ﬁrst place is even more complex; instead of doing it by hand, we’ll use a graphing
calculator or just “eyeball” the line, as we did above—using our visual sense to guess what line ﬁts best.
For more practice eyeballing lines of best ﬁt, try the Java applet at http://mste.illinois.edu/activity/
regression/. Click on the green ﬁeld to place up to 50 points on it, then use the slider to adjust the slope
of the red line to try and make it ﬁt the points. (The thermometer shows how far away the line is from the
points, so you want to try to make the thermometer reading as low as possible.) Then click “Show Best
Fit” to show the actual best ﬁt line in blue. Refresh the page or click “Reset” if you want to try again.
For more of a challenge, try scattering the points in a less obvious pattern.


Write an Equation For a Line of Best Fit
Once you draw the line of best ﬁt, you can ﬁnd its equation by using two points on the line. Finding the
equation of the line of best ﬁt is also called linear regression.
Caution: Make sure you don’t get caught making a common mistake. Sometimes the line of best ﬁt won’t
pass straight through any of the points in the original data set. This means that you can’t just use two
points from the data set – you need to use two points that are on the line, which might not be in
the data set at all.
In Example 1, it happens that two of the data points are very close to the line of best ﬁt, so we can just

use these points to ﬁnd the equation of the line: (1, 4.5) and (3, 11).


Start with the slope-intercept form of a line: y = mx + b
Find the slope: m = 11−4.5 6.5
                     3−1 = 2 = 3.25.
So y = 3.25x + b.
Plug (3, 11) into the equation: 11 = 3.25(3) + b ⇒ b = 1.25
So the equation for the line that ﬁts the data best is y = 3.25x + 1.25.


Perform Linear Regression With a Graphing Calculator
The problem with eyeballing a line of best ﬁt, of course, is that you can’t be sure how accurate your guess
is. To get the most accurate equation for the line, we can use a graphing calculator instead. The calculator
uses a mathematical algorithm to ﬁnd the line that minimizes the sum of the squares.

**Example 2**

Use a graphing calculator to ﬁnd the equation of the line of best ﬁt for the following data:
(3, 12), (8, 20), (1, 7), (10, 23), (5, 18), (8, 24), (11, 30), (2, 10)

**Solution:**

Step 1: Input the data in your calculator.
Press [STAT] and choose the [EDIT] option. Input the data into the table by entering the x−values in
the ﬁrst column and the y−values in the second column.


Step 2: Find the equation of the line of best ﬁt.
Press [STAT] again use right arrow to select [CALC] at the top of the screen.
Chose option number 4, LinReg(ax + b), and press [ENTER]

The calculator will display LinReg(ax + b).
Press [ENTER] and you will be given the a− and b−values.


Here a represents the slope and b represents the y−intercept of the equation. The linear regression line is
y = 2.01x + 5.94.
Step 3. Draw the scatter plot.
To draw the scatter plot press [STATPLOT] [2nd] [Y=].


Choose Plot 1 and press [ENTER].
Press the On option and set the Type as scatter plot (the one highlighted in black).
Make sure that the X list and Y list names match the names of the columns of the table in Step 1.
Choose the box or plus as the mark, since the simple dot may make it diﬀicult to see the points.
Press [GRAPH] and adjust the window size so you can see all the points in the scatter plot.


Step 4. Draw the line of best ﬁt through the scatter plot.
Press [Y=]
Enter the equation of the line of best ﬁt that you just found: y = 2.01x + 5.94.
Press [GRAPH].


Solve Real-World Problems Using Linear Models of Scattered
Data
Once we’ve found the line of best ﬁt for a data set, we can use the equation of that line to predict other
data points.

**Example 3**

Nadia is training for a 5K race. The following table shows her times for each month of her training
program. Find an equation of a line of ﬁt. Predict her running time if her race is in August.

                                                Table 5.1:

 Month                               Month number                        Average time (minutes)
 January                             0                                   40
 February                            1                                   38
 March                               2                                   39
 April                               3                                   38
 May                                 4                                   33
 June                                5                                   30


**Solution:**

Let’s make a scatter plot of Nadia’s running times. The independent variable, x, is the month number and
the dependent variable, y, is the running time. We plot all the points in the table on the coordinate plane,
and then sketch a line of ﬁt.


Two points on the line are (0, 42) and (4, 34). We’ll use them to ﬁnd the equation of the line:
                                               34 − 42    8
                                          m=           = − = −2
                                                4−0       4
                                           y = −2x + b
                                         42 = −2(0) + b ⇒ b = 42
                                           y = −2x + 42

In a real-world problem, the slope and y−intercept have a physical signiﬁcance. In this case, the slope tells
us how Nadia’s running time changes each month she trains. Speciﬁcally, it decreases by 2 minutes per
month. Meanwhile, the y−intercept tells us that when Nadia started training, she ran a distance of 5K in
42 minutes.
The problem asks us to predict Nadia’s running time in August. Since June is deﬁned as month number
5, August will be month number 7. We plug x = 7 into the equation of the line of best ﬁt:

                                      y = −2(7) + 42 = −14 + 42 = 28

The equation predicts that Nadia will run the 5K race in 28 minutes.
In this solution, we eyeballed a line of ﬁt. Using a graphing calculator, we can ﬁnd this equation for a line
of ﬁt instead: y = −2.2x + 43.7
If we plug x = 7 into this equation, we get y = −2.2(7) + 43.7 = 28.3. This means that Nadia will run
her race in 28.3 minutes. You see that the graphing calculator gives a diﬀerent equation and a diﬀerent
answer to the question. The graphing calculator result is more accurate, but the line we drew by hand
still gives a good approximation to the result. And of course, there’s no guarantee that Nadia will actually
ﬁnish the race in that exact time; both answers are estimates, it’s just that the calculator’s estimate is
slightly more likely to be right.

**Example 4**

Peter is testing the burning time of “BriteGlo” candles. The following table shows how long it takes to
burn candles of diﬀerent weights. Assume it’s a linear relation, so we can use a line to ﬁt the data. If a
candle burns for 95 hours, what must be its weight in ounces?

                                                Table 5.2:

 Candle weight (oz)                                    Time (hours)
 2                                                     15
 3                                                     20
 4                                                     35
 5                                                     36
 10                                                    80
 16                                                    100
 22                                                    120
 26                                                    180


**Solution:**

Let’s make a scatter plot of the data. The independent variable, x, is the candle weight and the dependent
variable, y, is the time it takes the candle to burn. We plot all the points in the table on the coordinate
plane, and draw a line of ﬁt.

Two convenient points on the line are (0,0) and (30, 200). Find the equation of the line:
                                             200    20
                                         m=       =
                                              30     3
                                          y=    x+b
                                          0 = (0) + b ⇒ b = 0
                                          y=    x

A slope of 20    2                                                                                      2
           3 = 6 3 tells us that for each extra ounce of candle weight, the burning time increases by 6 3
hours. A y−intercept of zero tells us that a candle of weight 0 oz will burn for 0 hours.
The problem asks for the weight of a candle that burns 95 hours; in other words, what’s the x−value that
gives a y−value of 95? Plugging in y = 95:
                                   20          20      285   57      1
                              y=      x ⇒ 95 =    x⇒x=     =    = 14
                                   3            3      20    4       4

A candle that burns 95 hours weighs 14.25 oz.
A graphing calculator gives the linear regression equation as y = 6.1x + 5.9 and a result of 14.6 oz.

## 5.4 Predicting with Linear Models


### Learning Objectives

- Interpolate using an equation.
- Extrapolate using an equation.
- Predict using an equation.


Introduction
Katja’s sales ﬁgures were trending downward quickly at ﬁrst, and she used a line of best ﬁt to describe the
numbers. But now they seem to be decreasing more slowly, and ﬁtting the line less and less accurately.
How can she make a more accurate prediction of what next week’s sales will be?
In the last lesson we saw how to ﬁnd the equation of a line of best ﬁt and how to use this equation to
make predictions. The line of “best ﬁt” is a good method if the relationship between the dependent and
the independent variables is linear. In this section you will learn other methods that are useful even when
the relationship isn’t linear.


Linear Interpolation
We use linear interpolation to ﬁll in gaps in our data—that is, to estimate values that fall in between the
values we already know. To do this, we use a straight line to connect the known data points on either side
of the unknown point, and use the equation of that line to estimate the value we are looking for.

Estimate the median age for the ﬁrst marriage of a male in the year 1946.

**Solution:**

We connect the two points on either side of 1946 with a straight line and ﬁnd its equation. Here’s how

that looks on a scatter plot:


We ﬁnd the equation by plugging in the two data points:
                                           22.8 − 24.3   −1.5
                                      m=               =      = −0.15
                                          1950 − 1940     10
                                      y = −0.15x + b
                                  24.3 = −0.15(1940) + b
                                      b = 315.3

Our equation is y = −0.15x + 315.3.
To estimate the median age of marriage of males in the year 1946, we plug x = 1946 into the equation we
just found:
y = −0.15(1946) + 315.3 = 23.4 years old

Estimate the percentage of pregnant women that were smoking in the year 1998.


**Solution:**

We connect the two points on either side of 1998 with a straight line and ﬁnd its equation. Here’s how
that looks on a scatter plot:


We ﬁnd the equation by plugging in the two data points:
                                            12.2 − 13.6   −1.4
                                      m=                =      = −0.35
                                           2000 − 1996     4
                                       y = −0.35x + b
                                  12.2 = −0.35(2000) + b
                                       b = 712.2

Our equation is y = −0.35x + 712.2.
To estimate the percentage of pregnant women who smoked in the year 1998, we plug x = 1998 into the
equation we just found:

                                      y = −0.35(1998) + 712.2 = 12.9%

For non-linear data, linear interpolation is often not accurate enough for our purposes. If the points in
the data set change by a large amount in the interval you’re interested in, then linear interpolation may
not give a good estimate. In that case, it can be replaced by polynomial interpolation, which uses a
curve instead of a straight line to estimate values between points. But that’s beyond the scope of this
lesson.


Linear Extrapolation
Linear extrapolation can help us estimate values that are outside the range of our data set. The strategy
is similar to linear interpolation: we pick the two data points that are closest to the one we’re looking
for, ﬁnd the equation of the line between them, and use that equation to estimate the coordinates of the
missing point.

**Solution:**

We start by making a scatter plot of the data; then we connect the last two points on the graph and ﬁnd
the equation of the line.


                                            10.5 − 10.9   −0.4
                                       m=               =      = −0.067
                                           1988 − 1982     6
                                       y = −0.067x + b
                                    10.5 = −0.067(1988) + b
                                       b = 143.7

Our equation is y = −0.067x + 143.7.
The winning time in year 2010 is estimated to be:
y = −0.067(2010) + 143.7 = 9.03 seconds.
Unfortunately, this estimate actually isn’t very accurate. This example demonstrates the weakness of linear
extrapolation; it uses only a couple of points, instead of using all the points like the best ﬁt line method, so

it doesn’t give as accurate results when the data points follow a linear pattern. In this particular example,
the last data point clearly doesn’t ﬁt in with the general trend of the data, so the slope of the extrapolation
line is much steeper than it would be if we’d used a line of best ﬁt. (As a historical note, the last data
point corresponds to the winning time for Florence Griﬀith Joyner in 1988. After her race she was accused
of using performance-enhancing drugs, but this fact was never proven. In addition, there was a question
about the accuracy of the timing: some oﬀicials said that tail-wind was not accounted for in this race, even
though all the other races of the day were aﬀected by a strong wind.)
Here’s an example of a problem where linear extrapolation does work better than the line of best ﬁt method.

**Example 4**

A cylinder is ﬁlled with water to a height of 73 centimeters. The water is drained through a hole in the
bottom of the cylinder and measurements are taken at 2 second intervals. The following table shows the
height of the water level in the cylinder at diﬀerent times.

a) Find the water level at time 15 seconds.
b) Find the water level at time 27 seconds
c) What would be the original height of the water in the cylinder if the water takes 5 extra seconds to drain?
(Find the height at time of –5 seconds.)

**Solution:**

Here’s what the line of best ﬁt would look like for this data set:

Notice that the data points don’t really make a line, and so the line of best ﬁt still isn’t a terribly good ﬁt.
Just a glance tells us that we’d estimate the water level at 15 seconds to be about 27 cm, which is more
than the water level at 14 seconds. That’s clearly not possible! Similarly, at 27 seconds we’d estimate the
water to have all drained out, which it clearly hasn’t yet.
So let’s see what happens if we use linear extrapolation and interpolation instead. First, here are the lines
we’d use to interpolate between 14 and 16 seconds, and between 26 and 28 seconds.


a) The slope of the line between points (14, 21.9) and (16, 17.1) is m = 17.1−21.9
                                                                             16−14  = −4.8
                                                                                       2   = −2.4. So
y = −2.4x + b ⇒ 21.9 = −2.4(14) + b ⇒ b = 55.5, and the equation is y = −2.4x + 55.5.
Plugging in x = 15 gives us y = −2.4(15) + 55.5 = 19.5 cm.
                                                                     0.7−2
b) The slope of the line between points (26, 2) and (28, 0.7) is m = 28−26 = −1.3
                                                                              2 = −.65, so y = −.65x + b ⇒
2 = −.65(26) + b ⇒ b = 18.9, and the equation is y = −.65x + 18.9.
Plugging in x = 27, we get y = −.65(27) + 18.9 = 1.35 cm.
c) Finally, we can use extrapolation to estimate the height of the water at -5 seconds. The slope of the
line between points (0, 73) and (2, 63.9) is m = 63.9−73
                                                    2−0   = −9.1
                                                              2 = −4.55, so the equation of the line is


y = −4.55x + 73.
Plugging in x = −5 gives us y = −4.55(−5) + 73 = 95.75 cm.

## 6.1 Solving Inequalities

- Write and graph inequalities in one variable on a number line.
- Solve inequalities using addition and subtraction.
- Solve inequalities using multiplication and division.
- Solve multi-step inequalities.


Introduction
Dita has a budget of $350 to spend on a rental car for an upcoming trip, but she wants to spend as little
of that money as possible. If the trip will last ﬁve days, what range of daily rental rates should she be
willing to consider?
Like equations, inequalities show a relationship between two expressions. We solve and graph inequalities
in a similar way to equations—but when we solve an inequality, the answer is usually a set of values instead
of just one value.
When writing inequalities we use the following symbols:
> is greater than
≥ is greater than or equal to
< is less than
≤ is less than or equal to


Write and Graph Inequalities in One Variable on a Number Line

Let’s start with the simple inequality x > 3.
We read this inequality as “x is greater than 3.” The solution is the set of all real numbers that are greater
than three. We often represent the solution set of an inequality with a number line graph.

Consider another simple inequality: x ≤ 4.
We read this inequality as “x is less than or equal to 4.” The solution is the set of all real numbers that are
equal to four or less than four. We can graph this solution set on the number line.


Notice that we use an empty circle for the endpoint of a strict inequality (like x > 3), and a ﬁlled circle for
one where the equals sign is included (like x ≤ 4).

**Example 1**

Graph the following inequalities on the number line.
a) x < −3
b) x ≥ 6
c) x > 0
d) x ≤ 8

**Solution:**

a) The inequality x < −3 represents all numbers that are less than -3. The number -3 is not included in
the solution, so it is represented by an open circle on the graph.


b) The inequality x ≥ 6 represents all numbers that are greater than or equal to 6. The number 6 is
included in the solution, so it is represented by a closed circle on the graph.


c) The inequality x > 0 represents all numbers that are greater than 0. The number 0 is not included in
the solution, so it is represented by an open circle on the graph.


d) The inequality x ≤ 8 represents all numbers that are less than or equal to 8. The number 8 is included
in the solution, so it is represented by a closed circle on the graph.


**Example 2**

Write the inequality that is represented by each graph.
a)

b)


c)


d)


**Solution:**

a) x ≤ −12
b) x > 540
c) x < 6.5
d) x ≥ 85
Inequalities appear everywhere in real life. Here are some simple examples of real-world applications.

**Example 3**

Write each statement as an inequality and graph it on the number line.
a) You must maintain a balance of at least $2500 in your checking account to get free checking.
b) You must be at least 48 inches tall to ride the “Thunderbolt” Rollercoaster.
c) You must be younger than 3 years old to get free admission at the San Diego Zoo.
d) The speed limit on the interstate is 65 miles per hour or less.

**Solution:**

a) The words “at least” imply that the value of $2500 is included in the solution set, so the inequality is
written as x ≥ 2500.


b) The words “at least” imply that the value of 48 inches is included in the solution set, so the inequality
is written as x ≥ 48.


c) The inequality is written as x < 3.


d) Speed limit means the highest allowable speed, so the inequality is written as x ≤ 65.


Solving Inequalities Using Addition and Subtraction
To solve an inequality we must isolate the variable on one side of the inequality sign. To isolate the variable,
we use the same basic techniques used in solving equations.
We can solve some inequalities by adding or subtracting a constant from one side of the inequality.

**Example 4**

Solve each inequality and graph the solution set.
a) x − 3 < 10
b) x − 20 ≥ 14

c) x + 8 ≤ −7
d) x + 4 > 13

**Solution:**

a) Starting inequality: x − 3 < 10
Add 3 to both sides of the inequality: x − 3 + 3 < 10 + 3
Simplify: x < 13


b) Starting inequality: x − 20 ≤ 14
Add 20 to both sides of the inequality: x − 20 + 20 ≤ 14 + 20
Simplify: x ≤ 34


c) Starting inequality: x + 8 ≤ −7
Subtract 8 from both sides of the inequality: x + 8 − 8 ≤ −7 − 8
Simplify: x ≤ −15


d) Starting inequality: x + 4 > 13
Subtract 4 from both sides of the inequality: x + 4 − 4 > 13 − 4
Simplify: x > 9


Solving Inequalities Using Multiplication and Division
We can also solve inequalities by multiplying or dividing both sides by a constant. For example, to solve
the inequality 5x < 3, we would divide both sides by 5 to get x < 35 .
However, something diﬀerent happens when we multiply or divide by a negative number. We know, for
example, that 5 is greater than 3. But if we multiply both sides of the inequality 5 > 3 by -2, we get
−10 > −6. And we know that’s not true; -10 is less than -6.
This happens whenever we multiply or divide an inequality by a negative number, and so we have to ﬂip
the sign around to make the inequality true. For example, to multiply 2 < 4 by -3, ﬁrst we multiply the 2
and the 4 each by -3, and then we change the < sign to a > sign, so we end up with −6 > −12.
The same principle applies when the inequality contains variables.

**Example 5**

Solve each inequality.
a) 4x < 24
b) −5x ≤ 21
    x
c) 25 < 32

    x
d) −7 ≥9

**Solution:**

a) Original problem: 4x < 24

                        4 < 4
Divide both sides by 4: 4x  24

Simplify: x < 6
b) Original problem: −5x ≤ 21
Divide both sides by -5 : −5x
                          −5 ≥ −5 Flip the inequality sign.

Simplify: x ≥ − 21
                      x
c) Original problem: 25 < 32
Multiply both sides by 25: 25 · 25
                                 x
                                   < 32 · 25
Simplify: x < 75
               2 or x < 37.5
                      x
d) Original problem: −7 ≥9
Multiply both sides by -7: −7 · −7
                                 x
                                   ≤ 9 · (−7) Flip the inequality sign.
Simplify: x ≤ −63


Solving Multi-Step Inequalities
In the last two sections, we considered very simple inequalities which required one step to obtain the
solution. However, most inequalities require several steps to arrive at the solution. As with solving equa-
tions, we must use the order of operations to ﬁnd the correct solution. In addition, remember that when
we multiply or divide the inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality
changes.
The general procedure for solving multi-step inequalities is almost exactly like the procedure for solving
multi-step equations:

  1. Clear parentheses on both sides of the inequality and collect like terms.
  2. Add or subtract terms so the variable is on one side and the constant is on the other side of the
     inequality sign.
  3. Multiply and divide by whatever constants are attached to the variable. Remember to change the
     direction of the inequality if you multiply or divide by a negative number.


**Example 6**

Solve each of the following inequalities and graph the solution set.

   5 − 7 ≥ −3x + 12
a) 9x
b) −25x + 12 ≤ −10x − 12

**Solution:**


                     5 − 7 ≥ −3x + 12
a) Original problem: 9x

                      5 + 3x − 7 ≥ −3x + 3x + 12
Add 3x to both sides: 9x

           5 − 7 ≥ 12
Simplify: 24x

                      5 − 7 + 7 ≥ 12 + 7
Add 7 to both sides: 24x

           5 ≥ 19
Simplify: 24x

Multiply 5 to both sides: 5 · 24x
                               5 ≥ 5 · 19
Simplify: 24x ≥ 95

                         24 ≥ 24
Divide both sides by 24: 24x  95

Simplify: x ≥ 95

b) Original problem: −25x + 12 ≤ −10x − 12
Add 10x to both sides: −25x + 10x + 12 ≤ −10x + 10x − 12
Simplify: −15x + 12 ≤ −12
Subtract 12: −15x + 12 − 12 ≤ −12 − 12
Simplify: −15x ≤ −24
Divide both sides by -15: −15x  −24

**Example 7**

Solve the following inequalities.
a) 4x − 2(3x − 9) ≤ −4(2x − 9)

     4 > −2(x + 5)
b) 5x−1

**Solution:**

a) Original problem: 4x − 2(3x − 9) ≤ −4(2x − 9)
Simplify parentheses: 4x − 6x + 18 ≤ −8x + 36
Collect like terms: −2x + 18 ≤ −8x + 36
Add 8x to both sides: −2x + 8x + 18 ≤ −8x + 8x + 36
Simplify: 6x + 18 ≤ 36
Subtract 18: 6x + 18 − 18 ≤ 36 − 18
Simplify: 6x ≤ 18

                        6 ≤ 6
Divide both sides by 6: 6x  18

Simplify: x ≤ 3 Answer

                       4 > −2(x + 5)
b) Original problem: 5x−1

                        4 > −2x − 10
Simplify parenthesis: 5x−1

                                4 > 4(−2x − 10)
Multiply both sides by 4: 4 · 5x−1
Simplify: 5x − 1 > −8x − 40
Add 8x to both sides: 5x + 8x − 1 > −8x + 8x − 40
Simplify: 13x − 1 > −40
Add 1 to both sides: 13x − 1 + 1 > −40 + 1
Simplify: 13x > −39


                         13 > − 13
Divide both sides by 13: 13x    39

Simplify: x > −3 Answer

Lesson Summary
- The answer to an inequality is usually an interval of values.
- Solving inequalities works just like solving an equation. To solve, we isolate the variable on one side
    of the equation.
- When multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you need to reverse
    the inequality.

## 6.2 Using Inequalities


### Learning Objectives

- Express answers to inequalities in a variety of ways.
- Identify the number of solutions of an inequality.
- Solve real-world problems using inequalities.


Introduction
Ms. Jerome wants to buy identical boxes of art supplies for her 25 students. If she can spend no more than
$375 on art supplies, what inequality describes the price can she aﬀord for each individual box of supplies?


Expressing Solutions of an Inequality
The solution of an inequality can be expressed in four diﬀerent ways:

  1. Inequality notation The answer is simply expressed as x < 15.
  2. Set notation The answer is expressed as a set: {x|x < 15}. The brackets indicate a set and the
     vertical line means “such that,” so we read this expression as “the set of all values of x such that x
     is a real number less than 15”.
  3. Interval notation uses brackets to indicate the range of values in the solution. For example, the
     answer to our problem would be expressed as (−∞, 15), meaning “the interval containing all the
     numbers from −∞ to 15 but not actually including −∞ or 15”.
      (a) Square or closed brackets “[” and “]” indicate that the number next to the bracket is included
          in the solution set.

      (b) Round or open brackets “(” and “)” indicate that the number next to the bracket is not
          included in the solution set. When using inﬁnity and negative inﬁnity (∞ and −∞), we
          always use open brackets, because inﬁnity isn’t an actual number and so it can’t ever really be
          included in an interval.
  4. Solution graph shows the solution on the real number line. A closed circle on a number indicates
     that the number is included in the solution set, while an open circle indicates that the number is not
     included in the set. For our example, the solution graph is:


**Example 1**

a) [-4, 6] means that the solutions is all numbers between -4 and 6 including -4 and 6.
b) (8, 24) means that the solution is all numbers between 8 and 24 not including the numbers 8 and 24.
c) [3, 12) means that the solution is all numbers between 3 and 12, including 3 but not including 12.
d) (−10, ∞) means that the solution is all numbers greater than -10, not including -10.
e) (−∞, ∞) means that the solution is all real numbers.


Identify the Number of Solutions of an Inequality
Inequalities can have:

- A set that has an inﬁnite number of solutions.
- A set that has a discrete number of solutions.
- No solutions.

The inequalities we have solved so far all have an inﬁnite number of solutions, at least in theory. For
                          4 > −2(x + 5) has the solution x > −3. This solution says that all real numbers
example, the inequality 5x−1
greater than -3 make this inequality true, and there are inﬁnitely many such numbers.
However, in real life, sometimes we are trying to solve a problem that can only have positive integer
answers, because the answers describe numbers of discrete objects.
For example, suppose you are trying to ﬁgure out how many $8 CDs you can buy if you want to spend less
than $50. An inequality to describe this situation would be 8x < 50, and if you solved that inequality you
               8 , or x < 6.25.
would get x < 50
But could you really buy any number of CDs as long as it’s less than 6.25? No; you couldn’t really buy

## 6.1 CDs, or -5 CDs, or any other fractional or negative number of CDs. So if we wanted to express our

solution in set notation, we couldn’t express it as the set of all numbers less than 6.25, or {x|x < 6.25}.
Instead, the solution is just the set containing all the nonnegative whole numbers less than 6.25, or {0, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When we’re solving a real-world problem dealing with discrete objects like CDs, our solution
set will often be a ﬁnite set of numbers instead of an inﬁnite interval.
An inequality can also have no solutions at all. For example, consider the inequality x − 5 > x + 6. When
we subtract x from both sides, we end up with −5 > 6, which is not true for any value of x. We say that
this inequality has no solution.
The opposite can also be true. If we ﬂip the inequality sign in the above inequality, we get x − 5 < x + 6,
which simpliﬁes to −5 < 6. That’s always true no matter what x is, so the solution to that inequality would
be all real numbers, or (−∞, ∞).

Solve Real-World Problems Using Inequalities
Solving real-world problems that involve inequalities is very much like solving problems that involve equa-
tions.

**Example 2**

In order to get a bonus this month, Leon must sell at least 120 newspaper subscriptions. He sold 85
subscriptions in the ﬁrst three weeks of the month. How many subscriptions must Leon sell in the last week
of the month?

**Solution:**

Let x = the number of subscriptions Leon sells in the last week of the month. The total number of
subscriptions for the month must be greater than 120, so we write 85 + x ≥ 120. We solve the inequality
by subtracting 85 from both sides: x ≥ 35.
Leon must sell 35 or more subscriptions in the last week to get his bonus.
To check the answer, we see that 85 + 35 = 120. If he sells 35 or more subscriptions, the total number of
subscriptions he sells that month will be 120 or more. The answer checks out.

**Example 3**

Virena’s Scout troop is trying to raise at least $650 this spring. How many boxes of cookies must they sell
at $4.50 per box in order to reach their goal?

**Solution:**

Let x = number of boxes sold. Then the inequality describing this problem is 4.50x ≥ 650.
We solve the inequality by dividing both sides by 4.50: x ≥ 144.44.
We round up the answer to 145 since only whole boxes can be sold.
Virena’s troop must sell at least 145 boxes.
If we multiply 145 by $4.50 we obtain $652.50, so if Virena’s troop sells more than 145 boxes they will
raise more than $650. But if they sell 144 boxes, they will only raise $648, which is not enough. So they
must indeed sell at least 145 boxes. The answer checks out.

**Example 4**

The width of a rectangle is 20 inches. What must the length be if the perimeter is at least 180 inches?

**Solution:**

Let x = length of the rectangle. The formula for perimeter is


                                    Perimeter = 2 × length + 2 × width


Since the perimeter must be at least 180 inches, we have 2x + 2(20) ≥ 180.
Simplify: 2x + 40 ≥ 180
Subtract 40 from both sides: 2x ≥ 140
Divide both sides by 2: x ≥ 70
The length must be at least 70 inches.
If the length is at least 70 inches and the width is 20 inches, then the perimeter is at least 2(70) + 2(20) =
180 inches. The answer checks out.

## 6.3 Compound Inequalities


### Learning Objectives

- Write and graph compound inequalities on a number line.
- Solve compound inequalities with “and.”
- Solve compound inequalities with “or.”
- Solve compound inequalities using a graphing calculator (TI family).
- Solve real-world problems using compound inequalities.


Introduction
In this section, we’ll solve compound inequalities—inequalities with more than one constraint on the
possible values the solution can have.
There are two types of compound inequalities:

  1. Inequalities joined by the word “and,” where the solution is a set of values greater than a number
     and less than another number. We can write these inequalities in the form “x > a and x < b,” but
     usually we just write “a < x < b.” Possible values for x are ones that will make both inequalities true.
  2. Inequalities joined by the word “or,” where the solution is a set of values greater than a number or
     less than another number. We write these inequalities in the form “x > a or x < b.” Possible values
     for x are ones that will make at least one of the inequalities true.

You might wonder why the variable x has to be greater than one number and/or less than the other number;
why can’t it be greater than both numbers, or less than both numbers? To see why, let’s take an example.
Consider the compound inequality “x > 5 and x > 3.” Are there any numbers greater than 5 that are not
greater than 3? No! Since 5 is greater than 3, everything greater than 5 is also greater than 3. If we say
x is greater than both 5 and 3, that doesn’t tell us any more than if we just said x is greater than 5. So
this compound inequality isn’t really compound; it’s equivalent to the simple inequality x > 5. And that’s
what would happen no matter which two numbers we used; saying that x is greater than both numbers
is just the same as saying that x is greater than the bigger number, and saying that x is less than both
numbers is just the same as saying that x is less than the smaller number.
Compound inequalities with “or” work much the same way. Every number that’s greater than 3 or greater
than 5 is also just plain greater than 3, and every number that’s greater than 3 is certainly greater than
3 or greater than 5—so if we say “x > 5 or x > 3,” that’s the same as saying just “x > 3.” Saying that x
is greater than at least one of two numbers is just the same as saying that x is greater than the smaller
number, and saying that x is less than at least one of two numbers is just the same as saying that x is less
than the greater number.

Write and Graph Compound Inequalities on a Number Line


**Example 1**

Write the inequalities represented by the following number line graphs.
a)

b)


c)


d)


**Solution:**

a) The solution graph shows that the solution is any value between -40 and 60, including -40 but not 60.
Any value in the solution set satisﬁes both x ≥ −40 and x < 60.
This is usually written as −40 ≤ x < 60.
b) The solution graph shows that the solution is any value greater than 1 (not including 1) or any value less
than -2 (not including -2). You can see that there can be no values that can satisfy both these conditions
at the same time. We write: x > 1 or x < −2.
c) The solution graph shows that the solution is any value greater than 4 (including 4) or any value less
than -1 (including - 1). We write: x ≥ 4 or x ≤ −1.
d) The solution graph shows that the solution is any value that is both less than 25 (not including 25) and
greater than -25 (not including -25). Any value in the solution set satisﬁes both x > −25 and x < 25.
This is usually written as −25 < x < 25.

**Example 2**

Graph the following compound inequalities on a number line.
a) −4 ≤ x ≤ 6
b) x < 0 or x > 2
c) x ≥ −8 or x ≤ −20
d) −15 < x ≤ 85

**Solution:**

a) The solution is all numbers between -4 and 6, including both -4 and 6.


b) The solution is all numbers less than 0 or greater than 2, not including 0 or 2.


c) The solution is all numbers greater than or equal to -8 or less than or equal to -20.


d) The solution is all numbers between -15 and 85, not including -15 but including 85.


Solve a Compound Inequality With “and” or “or”
When we solve compound inequalities, we separate the inequalities and solve each of them separately.
Then, we combine the solutions at the end.

**Example 3**

Solve the following compound inequalities and graph the solution set.
a) −2 < 4x − 5 ≤ 11
b) 3x − 5 < x + 9 ≤ 5x + 13

**Solution:**

a) First we re-write the compound inequality as two separate inequalities with and. Then solve each
inequality separately.

                                       − 2 < 4x − 5           4x − 5 ≤ 11
                                         3 < 4x        and         4x ≤ 16
                                           <x                       x≤4
Answer: 43 < x and x ≤ 4. This can be written as 34 < x ≤ 4.


b) Re-write the compound inequality as two separate inequalities with and. Then solve each inequality
separately.

                                   3x − 5 < x + 9            x + 9 ≤ 5x + 13
                                         2x < 14      and      − 4 ≤ 4x
                                          x<7                  −1≤ x

Answer: x < 7 and x ≥ −1. This can be written as: −1 ≤ x < 7.


**Example 4**

Solve the following compound inequalities and graph the solution set.
a) 9 − 2x ≤ 3 or 3x + 10 ≤ 6 − x

    6 ≤ 2x − 4 or 6 > x + 5
b) x−2            x−2


**Solution:**

a) Solve each inequality separately:

                                       9 − 2x ≤ 3           3x + 10 ≤ 6 − x
                                        − 2x ≤ −6      or       4x ≤ −4
                                           x≥3                    x ≤ −1

Answer: x ≥ 3 or x ≤ −1


b) Solve each inequality separately:


                                 x−2                       x−2
                                       ≤ 2x − 4                  > x+5
                                   6                         6
                                 x − 2 ≤ 6(2x − 4)         x − 2 > 6(x + 5)
                                 x − 2 ≤ 12x − 24     or   x − 2 > 6x + 30
                                       22 ≤ 11x             − 32 > 5x
                                        2≤x                 − 6.4 > x


Answer: x ≥ 2 or x < −6.4


The video at http://www.math-videos-online.com/solve-compound-inequality.html shows the pro-
cess of solving and graphing compound inequalities in more detail. One thing you may notice in this video
is that in the second problem, the two solutions joined with “or” overlap, and so the solution ends up being
the set of all real numbers, or (−∞, ∞). This happens sometimes with compound inequalities that involve
“or”; for example, if the solution to an inequality ended up being “x < 5 or x > 1,” the solution set would
be all real numbers. This makes sense if you think about it: all real numbers are either a) less than 5, or
b) greater than or equal to 5, and the ones that are greater than or equal to 5 are also greater than 1—so
all real numbers are either a) less than 5 or b) greater than 1.
Compound inequalities with “and,” meanwhile, can turn out to have no solutions. For example, the
inequality “x < 3 and x > 4” has no solutions: no number is both greater than 4 and less than 3. If we
write it as 4 < x < 3 it’s even more obvious that it has no solutions; 4 < x < 3 implies that 4 < 3, which is
false.


Solve Compound Inequalities Using a Graphing Calculator (TI-
83/84 family)
Graphing calculators can show you the solution to an inequality in the form of a graph. This can be
especially useful when dealing with compound inequalities.

**Example 5**

Solve the following inequalities using a graphing calculator.
a) 5x + 2(x − 3) ≥ 2
b) 7x − 2 < 10x + 1 < 9x + 5
c) 3x + 2 ≤ 10 or 3x + 2 ≥ 15

**Solution:**

a) Press the [Y=] button and enter the inequality on the ﬁrst line of the screen.

(To get the ≥ symbol, press [TEST] [2nd] [MATH] and choose option 4.)


Then press the [GRAPH] button.
Because the calculator uses the number 1 to mean “true” and 0 to mean “false,” you will see a step function
with the y−value jumping from 0 to 1.


The solution set is the values of x for which the graph shows y = 1—in other words, the set of x−values
that make the inequality true.


Note: You may need to press the [WINDOW] key or the [ZOOM] key to adjust the window to see the
full graph.
The solution is x > 87 , which is why you can see the y−value changing from 0 to 1 at about 1.14.
b) This is a compound inequality: 7x − 2 < 10x + 1 and 10x + 1 < 9x + 5. You enter it like this:


(To ﬁnd the [AND] symbol, press [TEST], choose [LOGIC] on the top row and choose option 1.)
The resulting graph should look like this:


The solution are the values of x for which y = 1; in this case that would be −1 < x < 4.
c) This is another compound inequality.


(To enter the [OR] symbol, press [TEST], choose [LOGIC] on the top row and choose option 2.)
The resulting graph should look like this:


The solution are the values of x for which y = 1–in this case, x ≤ 2.7 or x ≥ 4.3.


Solve Real-World Problems Using Compound Inequalities
Many application problems require the use of compound inequalities to ﬁnd the solution.

**Example 6**

The speed of a golf ball in the air is given by the formula v = −32t + 80. When is the ball traveling between
20 ft/sec and 30 ft/sec?


**Solution:**

First we set up the inequality 20 ≤ v ≤ 30, and then replace v with the formula v = −32t + 80 to get
20 ≤ −32t + 80 ≤ 30.
Then we separate the compound inequality and solve each separate inequality:

                                  20 ≤ −32t + 80            − 32t + 80 ≤ 30
                                 32t ≤ 60          and               50 ≤ 32t
                                     t ≤ 1.875                    1.56 ≤ t

Answer: 1.56 ≤ t ≤ 1.875
To check the answer, we plug in the minimum and maximum values of t into the formula for the speed.
For t = 1.56, v = −32t + 80 = −32(1.56) + 80 = 30 f t/sec
For t = 1.875, v = −32t + 80 = −32(1.875) + 80 = 20 f t/sec
So the speed is between 20 and 30 ft/sec. The answer checks out.

**Example 7**

William’s pick-up truck gets between 18 to 22 miles per gallon of gasoline. His gas tank can hold 15 gallons
of gasoline. If he drives at an average speed of 40 miles per hour, how much driving time does he get on a
full tank of gas?

**Solution:**

Let t = driving time. We can use dimensional analysis to get from time per tank to miles per gallon:
                                t hours     1 tank     40 miles 40t miles
                                        ×            ×         ×
                                 1 tank   15 gallons    1 hour   15 gallon

Since the truck gets between 18 and 22 miles/gallon, we set up the compound inequality 18 ≤ 40t
                                                                                            15 ≤ 22.
Then we separate the compound inequality and solve each inequality separately:
                                             40t             40t
                                        18 ≤                     ≤ 22
                                             15              15
                                       270 ≤ 40t    and      40t ≤ 330
                                       6.75 ≤ t                 t ≤ 8.25

Answer: 6.75 ≤ t ≤ 8.25.
Andrew can drive between 6.75 and 8.25 hours on a full tank of gas.
                                   40(6.75)
If we plug in t = 6.75 we get 40t
                              15 =    15    = 18 miles per gallon.
                                   40(8.25)
If we plug in t = 8.25 we get 40t
                              15 =    15    = 22 miles per gallon.
The answer checks out.

Introduction
Timmy is trying out his new roller skates. He’s not allowed to cross the street yet, so he skates back and
forth in front of his house. If he skates 20 yards east and then 10 yards west, how far is he from where he
started? What if he skates 20 yards west and then 10 yards east?
The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on a number line. There are always two numbers
on the number line that are the same distance from zero. For instance, the numbers 4 and -4 are each a
distance of 4 units away from zero.


|4| represents the distance from 4 to zero, which equals 4.
| − 4| represents the distance from -4 to zero, which also equals 4.
In fact, for any real number x:
|x| = x if x is not negative, and |x| = −x if x is negative.
Absolute value has no eﬀect on a positive number, but changes a negative number into its positive inverse.

**Example 1**

Evaluate the following absolute values.
a) |25|
b) | − 120|
c) | − 3|
d) |55|
e) − 54

**Solution:**

a) |25| = 25 Since 25 is a positive number, the absolute value does not change it.
b) | − 120| = 120 Since -120 is a negative number, the absolute value makes it positive.
c) | − 3| = 3 Since -3 is a negative number, the absolute value makes it positive.
d) |55| = 55 Since 55 is a positive number, the absolute value does not change it.
e) − 54 = 54 Since − 54 is a negative number, the absolute value makes it positive.
Absolute value is very useful in ﬁnding the distance between two points on the number line. The distance
between any two points a and b on the number line is |a − b| or |b − a|.
For example, the distance from 3 to -1 on the number line is |3 − (−1)| = |4| = 4.

We could have also found the distance by subtracting in the opposite order: | − 1 − 3| = | − 4| = 4. This
makes sense because the distance is the same whether you are going from 3 to -1 or from -1 to 3.

**Example 2**

Find the distance between the following points on the number line.
a) 6 and 15
b) -5 and 8
c) -3 and -12

**Solution:**

Distance is the absolute value of the diﬀerence between the two points.
a) distance = |6 − 15| = | − 9| = 9
b) distance = | − 5 − 8| = | − 13| = 13
c) distance = | − 3 − (−12)| = |9| = 9
Remember: When we computed the change in x and the change in y as part of the slope computa-
tion, these values were positive or negative, depending on the direction of movement. In this discussion,
“distance” means a positive distance only.


Solve an Absolute Value Equation
We now want to solve equations involving absolute values. Consider the following equation:
                                                    |x| = 8

This means that the distance from the number x to zero is 8. There are two numbers that satisfy this
condition: 8 and -8.


When we solve absolute value equations we always consider two possibilities:

   1. The expression inside the absolute value sign is not negative.
   2. The expression inside the absolute value sign is negative.

Then we solve each equation separately.

**Example 3**

Solve the following absolute value equations.
a) |x| = 3
b) |x| = 10

**Solution:**

a) There are two possibilities: x = 3 and x = −3.
b) There are two possibilities: x = 10 and x = −10.

Analyze Solutions to Absolute Value Equations

**Example 4**

Solve the equation |x − 4| = 5 and interpret the answers.

**Solution:**

We consider two possibilities: the expression inside the absolute value sign is nonnegative or is negative.
Then we solve each equation separately.

                                        x−4=5       and     x − 4 = −5
                                            x=9                 x = −1

x = 9 and x = −1 are the solutions.
The equation |x − 4| = 5 can be interpreted as “what numbers on the number line are 5 units away from
the number 4?” If we draw the number line we see that there are two possibilities: 9 and -1.


**Example 5**

Solve the equation |x + 3| = 2 and interpret the answers.

**Solution:**

Solve the two equations:

                                       x+3=2        and      x + 3 = −2
                                           x = −1               x = −5

x = −5 and x = −1 are the answers.
The equation |x + 3| = 2 can be re-written as: |x − (−3)| = 2. We can interpret this as “what numbers on
the number line are 2 units away from -3?” There are two possibilities: -5 and -1.


**Example 6**

Solve the equation |2x − 7| = 6 and interpret the answers.

**Solution:**

Solve the two equations:

                                      2x − 7 = 6             2x − 7 = −6
                                         2x = 13      and        2x = 1
                                              13                      1
                                          x=                      x=
                                               2                      2

Answer: x = 13         1
             2 and x = 2 .

The interpretation of this problem is clearer if the equation |2x − 7| = 6 is divided by 2 on both sides to get
2 |2x − 7| = 3. Because 2 is nonnegative, we can distribute it over the absolute value sign to get x − 2 = 3.
1                       1                                                                               7
The question then becomes “What numbers on the number line are 3 units away from 2 ?” There are two
answers: 13        1
            2 and 2 .


Graph Absolute Value Functions
Now let’s look at how to graph absolute value functions.
Consider the function y = |x − 1|. We can graph this function by making a table of values:

                                                 Table 6.1:

 x                                                      y = |x − 1|
  -2                                                    y = | − 2 − 1| = | − 3| = 3
 -1                                                     y = | − 1 − 1| = | − 2| = 2
 0                                                      y = |0 − 1| = | − 1| = 1
 1                                                      y = |1 − 1| = |0| = 0
 2                                                      y = |2 − 1| = |1| = 1
 3                                                      y = |3 − 1| = |2| = 2
 4                                                      y = |4 − 1| = |3| = 3


You can see that the graph of an absolute value function makes a big “V”. It consists of two line rays (or
line segments), one with positive slope and one with negative slope, joined at the vertex or cusp.
We’ve already seen that to solve an absolute value equation we need to consider two options:


     1. The expression inside the absolute value is not negative.
     2. The expression inside the absolute value is negative.


Combining these two options gives us the two parts of the graph.

For instance, in the above example, the expression inside the absolute value sign is x − 1. By deﬁnition,
this expression is nonnegative when x − 1 ≥ 0, which is to say when x ≥ 1. When the expression inside the
absolute value sign is nonnegative, we can just drop the absolute value sign. So for all values of x greater
than or equal to 1, the equation is just y = x − 1.
On the other hand, when x − 1 < 0 — in other words, when x < 1 — the expression inside the absolute value
sign is negative. That means we have to drop the absolute value sign but also multiply the expression by
-1. So for all values of x less than 1, the equation is y = −(x − 1), or y = −x + 1.
These are both graphs of straight lines, as shown above. They meet at the point where x − 1 = 0 — that
is, at x = 1.
We can graph absolute value functions by breaking them down algebraically as we just did, or we can
graph them using a table of values. However, when the absolute value equation is linear, the easiest way
to graph it is to combine those two techniques, as follows:

     1. Find the vertex of the graph by setting the expression inside the absolute value equal to zero and
        solving for x.
     2. Make a table of values that includes the vertex, a value smaller than the vertex, and a value larger
        than the vertex. Calculate the corresponding values of y using the equation of the function.
     3. Plot the points and connect them with two straight lines that meet at the vertex.


**Example 7**

Graph the absolute value function y = |x + 5|.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Find the vertex by solving x + 5 = 0. The vertex is at x = −5.
Step 2: Make a table of values:

                                                 Table 6.2:

 x                                                      y = |x + 5|
  -8                                                    y = | − 8 + 5| = | − 3| = 3
 -5                                                     y = | − 5 + 5| = |0| = 0
 -2                                                     y = | − 2 + 5| = |3| = 3


Step 3: Plot the points and draw two straight lines that meet at the vertex:


**Example 8**

Graph the absolute value function: y = |3x − 12|

**Solution:**

Step 1: Find the vertex by solving 3x − 12 = 0. The vertex is at x = 4.
Step 2: Make a table of values:

                                                  Table 6.3:

 x                                                       y = |3x − 12|
 0                                                       y = |3(0) − 12| = | − 12| = 12
 4                                                       y = |3(4) − 12| = |0| = 0
 8                                                       y = |3(8) − 12| = |12| = 12


Step 3: Plot the points and draw two straight lines that meet at the vertex.


Solve Real-World Problems Using Absolute Value Equations

**Example 9**

A company packs coﬀee beans in airtight bags. Each bag should weigh 16 ounces, but it is hard to ﬁll each
bag to the exact weight. After being ﬁlled, each bag is weighed; if it is more than 0.25 ounces overweight
or underweight, it is emptied and repacked. What are the lightest and heaviest acceptable bags?

**Solution:**

The weight of each bag is allowed to be 0.25 ounces away from 16 ounces; in other words, the diﬀerence
between the bag’s weight and 16 ounces is allowed to be 0.25 ounces. So if x is the weight of a bag in
ounces, then the equation that describes this problem is |x − 16| = 0.25.
Now we must consider the positive and negative options and solve each equation separately:

                                  x − 16 = 0.25       and      x − 16 = −0.25
                                      x = 16.25                     x = 15.75

The lightest acceptable bag weighs 15.75 ounces and the heaviest weighs 16.25 ounces.
We see that 16.25 − 16 = 0.25 ounces and 16 − 15.75 = 0.25 ounces. The answers are 0.25 ounces bigger
and smaller than 16 ounces respectively.

The answer checks out.
The answer you just found describes the lightest and heaviest acceptable bags of coﬀee beans. But how do
we describe the total possible range of acceptable weights? That’s where inequalities become useful once
again.


Absolute Value Inequalities
Absolute value inequalities are solved in a similar way to absolute value equations. In both cases, you must
consider the same two options:

   1. The expression inside the absolute value is not negative.
   2. The expression inside the absolute value is negative.

Then you must solve each inequality separately.


Solve Absolute Value Inequalities
Consider the inequality |x| ≤ 3. Since the absolute value of x represents the distance from zero, the solutions
to this inequality are those numbers whose distance from zero is less than or equal to 3. The following
graph shows this solution:


Notice that this is also the graph for the compound inequality −3 ≤ x ≤ 3.
Now consider the inequality |x| > 2. Since the absolute value of x represents the distance from zero, the
solutions to this inequality are those numbers whose distance from zero are more than 2. The following
graph shows this solution.


Notice that this is also the graph for the compound inequality x < −2 or x > 2.

**Example 1**

Solve the following inequalities and show the solution graph.
a) |x| < 5
b) |x| ≥ 2.5

**Solution:**

a) |x| < 5 represents all numbers whose distance from zero is less than 5.


This answer can be written as “−5 < x < 5”.
b) |x| ≥ 2.5 represents all numbers whose distance from zero is more than or equal to 2.5


This answer can be written as “x ≤ −2.5 or x ≥ 2.5”.

Rewrite and Solve Absolute Value Inequalities as Compound In-
equalities

In the last section you saw that absolute value inequalities are compound inequalities.
Inequalities of the type |x| < a can be rewritten as “−a < x < a”.
Inequalities of the type |x| > b can be rewritten as “x < −b or x > b.”
To solve an absolute value inequality, we separate the expression into two inequalities and solve each of
them individually.

**Example 2**

Solve the inequality |x − 3| < 7 and show the solution graph.

**Solution:**

Re-write as a compound inequality: −7 < x − 3 < 7
Write as two separate inequalities: x − 3 < 7 and x − 3 > −7
Solve each inequality: x < 10 and x > −4
Re-write solution: −4 < x < 10
The solution graph is

We can think of the question being asked here as “What numbers are within 7 units of 3?”; the answer
can then be expressed as “All the numbers between -4 and 10.”

**Example 3**

Solve the inequality |4x + 5| ≤ 13 and show the solution graph.

**Solution:**

Re-write as a compound inequality: −13 ≤ 4x + 5 ≤ 13
Write as two separate inequalities: 4x + 5 ≤ 13 and 4x + 5 ≥ −13
Solve each inequality: 4x ≤ 8 and 4x ≥ −18
x ≤ 2 and x ≥ − 29
Re-write solution: − 92 ≤ x ≤ 2
The solution graph is


**Example 4**

Solve the inequality |x + 12| > 2 and show the solution graph.

**Solution:**

Re-write as a compound inequality: x + 12 < −2 or x + 12 > 2
Solve each inequality: x < −14 or x > −10
The solution graph is


**Example 5**

Solve the inequality |8x − 15| ≥ 9 and show the solution graph.


**Solution:**

Re-write as a compound inequality: 8x − 15 ≤ −9 or 8x − 15 ≥ 9
Solve each inequality: 8x ≤ 6 or 8x ≥ 24
x ≤ 43 or x ≥ 3
The solution graph is


Solve Real-World Problems Using Absolute Value Inequalities
Absolute value inequalities are useful in problems where we are dealing with a range of values.

**Example 6**

The velocity of an object is given by the formula v = 25t − 80, where the time is expressed in seconds and
the velocity is expressed in feet per second. Find the times for which the magnitude of the velocity is greater
than or equal to 60 feet per second.

**Solution:**

The magnitude of the velocity is the absolute value of the velocity. If the velocity is 25t − 80 feet per second,
then its magnitude is |25t − 80| feet per second. We want to ﬁnd out when that magnitude is greater than
or equal to 60, so we need to solve |25t − 80| ≥ 60 for t.
First we have to split it up: 25t − 80 ≥ 60 or 25t − 80 ≤ −60
Then solve: 25t ≥ 140 or 25t ≤ 20
t ≥ 5.6 or t ≤ 0.8
The magnitude of the velocity is greater than 60 ft/sec for times less than 0.8 seconds and for times
greater than 5.6 seconds.
When t = 0.8 seconds, v = 25(0.8) − 80 = −60 f t/sec. The magnitude of the velocity is 60 ft/sec. (The
negative sign in the answer means that the object is moving backwards.)
When t = 5.6 seconds, v = 25(5.6) − 80 = 60 f t/sec.
To ﬁnd where the magnitude of the velocity is greater than 60 ft/sec, check some arbitrary values in each
of the following time intervals: t ≤ 0.8, 0.8 ≤ t ≤ 5.6 and t ≥ 5.6.
Check t = 0.5 : v = 25(0.5) − 80 = −67.5 f t/sec
Check t = 2 : v = 25(2) − 80 = −30 f t/sec
Check t = 6 : v = 25(6) − 80 = −70 f t/sec
You can see that the magnitude of the velocity is greater than 60 ft/sec only when t ≥ 5.6 or when t ≤ 0.8.
The answer checks out.

Lesson Summary
- The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on a number line.
- |x| = x if x is not negative, and |x| = −x if x is negative.
- An equation or inequality with an absolute value in it splits into two equations, one where the
    expression inside the absolute value sign is positive and one where it is negative. When the expression
    within the absolute value is positive, then the absolute value signs do nothing and can be omitted.
    When the expression within the absolute value is negative, then the expression within the absolute
    value signs must be negated before removing the signs.
- Inequalities of the type |x| < a can be rewritten as “−a < x < a.”
- Inequalities of the type |x| > b can be rewritten as “x < −b or x > b.”

Introduction
Yasmeen is selling handmade bracelets for $5 each and necklaces for $7 each. How many of both does she
need to sell to make at least $100?
A linear inequality in two variables takes the form y > mx + b or y < mx + b. Linear inequalities are
closely related to graphs of straight lines; recall that a straight line has the equation y = mx + b.
When we graph a line in the coordinate plane, we can see that it divides the plane in half:


The solution to a linear inequality includes all the points in one half of the plane. We can tell which half
by looking at the inequality sign:
> The solution set is the half plane above the line.

≥ The solution set is the half plane above the line and also all the points on the line.
< The solution set is the half plane below the line.
≤ The solution set is the half plane below the line and also all the points on the line.
For a strict inequality, we draw a dashed line to show that the points in the line are not part of the
solution. For an inequality that includes the equals sign, we draw a solid line to show that the points on
the line are part of the solution.
Here are some examples of linear inequality graphs. This is a graph of y ≥ mx + b; the solution set is the
line and the half plane above the line.


This is a graph of y < mx + b; the solution set is the half plane above the line, not including the line itself.


Graph Linear Inequalities in One Variable in the Coordinate
Plane
In the last few sections we graphed inequalities in one variable on the number line. We can also graph
inequalities in one variable on the coordinate plane. We just need to remember that when we graph an
equation of the type x = a we get a vertical line, and when we graph an equation of the type y = b we get
a horizontal line.

**Example 1**

Graph the inequality x > 4 on the coordinate plane.

**Solution:**


First let’s remember what the solution to x > 4 looks like on the number line.


The solution to this inequality is the set of all real numbers x that are bigger than 4, not including 4. The
solution is represented by a line.
In two dimensions, the solution still consists of all the points to the right of x = 4, but for all possible
y−values as well. This solution is represented by the half plane to the right of x = 4. (You can think of it
as being like the solution graphed on the number line, only stretched out vertically.)


The line x = 4 is dashed because the equals sign is not included in the inequality, meaning that points on
the line are not included in the solution.

**Example 2**

Graph the inequality |x| ≥ 2.

**Solution:**

The absolute value inequality |x| ≥ 2 can be re-written as a compound inequality:

                                             x ≤ −2 or     x≥2

In other words, the solution is all the coordinate points for which the value of x is smaller than or equal
to -2 or greater than or equal to 2. The solution is represented by the plane to the left of the vertical line
x = −2 and the plane to the right of line x = 2.


Both vertical lines are solid because points on the lines are included in the solution.


**Example 3**

Graph the inequality |y| < 5

**Solution:**

The absolute value inequality |y| < 5 can be re-written as −5 < y < 5. This is a compound inequality which
can be expressed as


                                            y > −5 and     y<5


In other words, the solution is all the coordinate points for which the value of y is larger than -5 and
smaller than 5. The solution is represented by the plane between the horizontal lines y = −5 and y = 5.


Both horizontal lines are dashed because points on the lines are not included in the solution.


Graph Linear Inequalities in Two Variables
The general procedure for graphing inequalities in two variables is as follows:


  1. Re-write the inequality in slope-intercept form: y = mx + b. Writing the inequality in this form lets
     you know the direction of the inequality.
  2. Graph the line of the equation y = mx + b using your favorite method (plotting two points, using
     slope and y−intercept, using y−intercept and another point, or whatever is easiest). Draw the line as
     a dashed line if the equals sign is not included and a solid line if the equals sign is included.
  3. Shade the half plane above the line if the inequality is “greater than.” Shade the half plane under the
     line if the inequality is “less than.”


**Example 4**

Graph the inequality y ≥ 2x − 3.

**Solution:**

The inequality is already written in slope-intercept form, so it’s easy to graph. First we graph the line
y = 2x − 3; then we shade the half-plane above the line. The line is solid because the inequality includes
the equals sign.


**Example 5**

Graph the inequality 5x − 2y > 4.

**Solution:**

First we need to rewrite the inequality in slope-intercept form:

                                              −2y > −5x + 4
                                                y< x−2

Notice that the inequality sign changed direction because we divided by a negative number.
To graph the equation, we can make a table of values:

                                               Table 6.4:

 x                                                     y

                                                        2 (−2) − 2 = −7
  -2
                                                        2 (0) − 2 = −2
                                                        2 (2) − 2 = 3


After graphing the line, we shade the plane below the line because the inequality in slope-intercept form
is less than. The line is dashed because the inequality does not include an equals sign.


Solve Real-World Problems Using Linear Inequalities

In this section, we see how linear inequalities can be used to solve real-world applications.

**Example 8**

A retailer sells two types of coﬀee beans. One type costs $9 per pound and the other type costs $7 per
pound. Find all the possible amounts of the two diﬀerent coﬀee beans that can be mixed together to get
a quantity of coﬀee beans costing $8.50 or less.

**Solution:**

Let x = weight of $9 per pound coﬀee beans in pounds.
Let y = weight of $7 per pound coﬀee beans in pounds.
The cost of a pound of coﬀee blend is given by 9x + 7y.
We are looking for the mixtures that cost $8.50 or less. We write the inequality 9x + 7y ≤ 8.50.
Since this inequality is in standard form, it’s easiest to graph it by ﬁnding the x− and y−intercepts. When
x = 0, we have 7y = 8.50 or y = 8.507 ≈ 1.21. When y = 0, we have 9x = 8.50 or x = 9 ≈ 0.94. We can
                                                                                         8.50

then graph the line that includes those two points.
Now we have to ﬁgure out which side of the line to shade. In y−intercept form, we shade the area below
the line when the inequality is “less than.” But in standard form that’s not always true. We could convert
the inequality to y−intercept form to ﬁnd out which side to shade, but there is another way that can be
easier.
The other method, which works for any linear inequality in any form, is to plug a random point into the
inequality and see if it makes the inequality true. Any point that’s not on the line will do; the point (0, 0)
is usually the most convenient.
In this case, plugging in 0 for x and y would give us 9(0) + 7(0) ≤ 8.50, which is true. That means we
should shade the half of the plane that includes (0, 0). If plugging in (0, 0) gave us a false inequality, that
would mean that the solution set is the part of the plane that does not contain (0, 0).


Notice also that in this graph we show only the ﬁrst quadrant of the coordinate plane. That’s because
weight values in the real world are always nonnegative, so points outside the ﬁrst quadrant don’t represent
real-world solutions to this problem.

**Example 9**

Julius has a job as an appliance salesman. He earns a commission of $60 for each washing machine he
sells and $130 for each refrigerator he sells. How many washing machines and refrigerators must Julius

sell in order to make $1000 or more in commissions?

**Solution:**

Let x = number of washing machines Julius sells.
Let y = number of refrigerators Julius sells.
The total commission is 60x + 130y.
We’re looking for a total commission of $1000 or more, so we write the inequality 60x + 130y ≥ 1000.
Once again, we can do this most easily by ﬁnding the x− and y−intercepts. When x = 0, we have
                     30 ≈ 7.69. When y = 0, we have 60x = 1000, or x = 60 ≈ 16.67.
130y = 1000, or y = 1000                                              1000

We draw a solid line connecting those points, and shade above the line because the inequality is “greater
than.” We can check this by plugging in the point (0, 0): selling 0 washing machines and 0 refrigerators
would give Julius a commission of $0, which is not greater than or equal to $1000, so the point (0, 0) is
not part of the solution; instead, we want to shade the side of the line that does not include it.


Notice also that we show only the ﬁrst quadrant of the coordinate plane, because Julius’s commission
should be nonnegative.

amples of real-world problems using inequalities in two variables.

# Chapter 7: Solving Systems of Equations

and Inequalities


## 7.1 Linear Systems by Graphing


### Learning Objectives

- Determine whether an ordered pair is a solution to a system of equations.
- Solve a system of equations graphically.
- Solve a system of equations graphically with a graphing calculator.
- Solve word problems using systems of equations.


Introduction
In this lesson, we’ll discover methods to determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two
equations. Then we’ll learn to solve the two equations graphically and conﬁrm that the solution is the
point where the two lines intersect. Finally, we’ll look at real-world problems that can be solved using the
methods described in this chapter.


Determine Whether an Ordered Pair is a Solution to a System
of Equations
A linear system of equations is a set of equations that must be solved together to ﬁnd the one solution
that ﬁts them both.
Consider this system of equations:

                                                y= x+2
                                                y = −2x + 1

Since the two lines are in a system, we deal with them together by graphing them on the same coordinate
axes. We can use any method to graph them; let’s do it by making a table of values for each line.
Line 1: y = x + 2


                                                  Table 7.1:

 x                                                       y
 0                                                       2
 1                                                       3


Line 2: y = −2x + 1

                                                  Table 7.2:

 x                                                       y
 0                                                       1
 1                                                       -1


We already know that any point that lies on a line is a solution to the equation for that line. That means
that any point that lies on both lines in a system is a solution to both equations.
So in this system:

- Point A is not a solution to the system because it does not lie on either of the lines.
- Point B is not a solution to the system because it lies only on the blue line but not on the red line.
- Point C is a solution to the system because it lies on both lines at the same time.

In fact, point C is the only solution to the system, because it is the only point that lies on both lines.
For a system of equations, the geometrical solution is the intersection of the two lines in the system. The
algebraic solution is the ordered pair that solves both equations—in other words, the coordinates of that
intersection point.
You can conﬁrm the solution by plugging it into the system of equations, and checking that the solution
works in each equation.

**Example 1**

Determine which of the points (1, 3), (0, 2), or (2, 7) is a solution to the following system of equations:

                                                  y = 4x − 1
                                                  y = 2x + 3


**Solution:**

To check if a coordinate point is a solution to the system of equations, we plug each of the x and y values
into the equations to see if they work.
Point (1, 3):

                                         y = 4x − 1
                                       3 ? = ? 4(1) − 1
                                         3 = 3 solution checks


                                         y = 2x + 3
                                       3 ? = ? 2(1) + 3
                                         3 , 5 solution does not check


Point (1, 3) is on the line y = 4x − 1, but it is not on the line y = 2x + 3, so it is not a solution to the
system.
Point (0, 2):

                                        y = 4x − 1
                                      2 ? = ? 4(0) − 1
                                        2 , −1 solution does not check

Point (0, 2) is not on the line y = 4x − 1, so it is not a solution to the system. Note that it is not necessary
to check the second equation because the point needs to be on both lines for it to be a solution to the
system.
Point (2, 7):

                                             y = 4x − 1
                                           7 ? = ? 4(2) − 1
                                             7 = 7 solution checks


                                             y = 2x + 3
                                           7 ? = ? 2(2) + 3
                                             7 = 7 solution checks

Point (2, 7) is a solution to the system since it lies on both lines.
The solution to the system is the point (2, 7).


Determine the Solution to a Linear System by Graphing
The solution to a linear system of equations is the point, (if there is one) that lies on both lines. In other
words, the solution is the point where the two lines intersect.
We can solve a system of equations by graphing the lines on the same coordinate plane and reading the
intersection point from the graph.

This method most often oﬀers only approximate solutions, so it’s not suﬀicient when you need an exact
answer. However, graphing the system of equations can be a good way to get a sense of what’s really going
on in the problem you’re trying to solve, especially when it’s a real-world problem.

**Example 2**

Solve the following system of equations by graphing:

                                                  y = 3x − 5
                                                  y = −2x + 5


**Solution:**

Graph both lines on the same coordinate axis using any method you like.
In this case, let’s make a table of values for each line.
Line 1: y = 3x − 5

                                                  Table 7.3:

 x                                                          y
 1                                                          -2
 2                                                          1


Line 2: y = −2x + 5

                                                  Table 7.4:

 x                                                          y
 1                                                          3
 2                                                          1


The solution to the system is given by the intersection point of the two lines. The graph shows that the
lines intersect at point (2, 1). So the solution is x = 2, y = 1 or (2, 1).

**Example 3**

Solve the following system of equations by graphing:

                                                   2x + 3y = 6
                                                    4x − y = −2


**Solution:**

Since the equations are in standard form, this time we’ll graph them by ﬁnding the x− and y−intercepts
of each of the lines.
Line 1: 2x + 3y = 6
x−intercept: set y = 0 ⇒ 2x = 6 ⇒ x = 3 so the intercept is (3, 0)
y−intercept: set x = 0 ⇒ 3y = 6 ⇒ y = 2 so the intercept is (0, 2)
Line 2: −4x + y = 2
                                                               (         )
x−intercept: set y = 0 ⇒ −4x = 2 ⇒ x = − 21 so the intercept is − 12 , 0
y−intercept: set x = 0 ⇒ y = 2 so the intercept is (0, 2)


The graph shows that the lines intersect at (0, 2). Therefore, the solution to the system of equations
is x = 0, y = 2.


Solving a System of Equations Using a Graphing Calculator
As an alternative to graphing by hand, you can use a graphing calculator to ﬁnd or check solutions to a
system of equations.

**Example 4**

Solve the following system of equations using a graphing calculator.

                                                     x − 3y = 4
                                                   2x + 5y = 8

To input the equations into the calculator, you need to rewrite them in slope-intercept form (that is,
y = mx + b form).
x − 3y = 4                       y = 31 x − 43
                    ⇒
2x + 5y = 8                      y = − 25 x + 85

Press the [y=] button on the graphing calculator and enter the two functions as:


                                                   x 4
                                              Y1 =   −
                                                   3 3
                                                   −2x 8
                                              Y2 =     +
                                                    5    5


Now press [GRAPH]. Here’s what the graph should look like on a TI-83 family graphing calculator with
the window set to −5 ≤ x ≤ 10 and −5 ≤ y ≤ 5.


There are a few diﬀerent ways to ﬁnd the intersection point.
Option 1: Use [TRACE] and move the cursor with the arrows until it is on top of the intersection point.
The values of the coordinate point will be shown on the bottom of the screen. The second screen above
shows the values to be X = 4.0957447 and Y = 0.03191489.
Use the [ZOOM] function to zoom into the intersection point and ﬁnd a more accurate result. The third
screen above shows the system of equations after zooming in several times. A more accurate solution
appears to be X = 4 and Y = 0.
Option 2 Look at the table of values by pressing [2nd] [GRAPH]. The ﬁrst screen below shows a table
of values for this system of equations. Scroll down until the Y−values for the two functions are the same.
In this case this occurs at X = 4 and Y = 0.
(Use the [TBLSET] function to change the starting value for your table of values so that it is close to the
intersection point and you don’t have to scroll too long. You can also improve the accuracy of the solution
by setting the value of ∆ Table smaller.)


Option 3 Using the [2nd] [TRACE] function gives the second screen shown above.
Scroll down and select “intersect.”
The calculator will display the graph with the question [FIRSTCURVE]? Move the cursor along the ﬁrst
curve until it is close to the intersection and press [ENTER].
The calculator now shows [SECONDCURVE]?
Move the cursor to the second line (if necessary) and press [ENTER].
The calculator displays [GUESS]?
Press [ENTER] and the calculator displays the solution at the bottom of the screen (see the third screen
above).
The point of intersection is X = 4 and Y = 0. Note that with this method, the calculator works out the
intersection point for you, which is generally more accurate than your own visual estimate.

Solve Real-World Problems Using Graphs of Linear Systems
Consider the following problem:
Peter and Nadia like to race each other. Peter can run at a speed of 5 feet per second and Nadia can run
at a speed of 6 feet per second. To be a good sport, Nadia likes to give Peter a head start of 20 feet. How
long does Nadia take to catch up with Peter? At what distance from the start does Nadia catch up with
Peter?
Let’s start by drawing a sketch. Here’s what the race looks like when Nadia starts running; we’ll call this
time t = 0.


Now let’s deﬁne two variables in this problem:
t = the time from when Nadia starts running
d = the distance of the runners from the starting point.
Since there are two runners, we need to write equations for each of them. That will be the system of
equations for this problem.
For each equation, we use the formula: distance = speed × time
Nadia’s equation: d = 6t
Peter’s equation: d = 5t + 20
(Remember that Peter was already 20 feet from the starting point when Nadia started running.)
Let’s graph these two equations on the same coordinate axes.
Time should be on the horizontal axis since it is the independent variable. Distance should be on the
vertical axis since it is the dependent variable.


We can use any method for graphing the lines, but in this case we’ll use the slope–intercept method since
it makes more sense physically.
To graph the line that describes Nadia’s run, start by graphing the y−intercept: (0, 0). (If you don’t see
that this is the y−intercept, try plugging in the test-value of x = 0.)
The slope tells us that Nadia runs 6 feet every one second, so another point on the line is (1, 6). Connecting
these points gives us Nadia’s line:

To graph the line that describes Peter’s run, again start with the y−intercept. In this case this is the point
(0, 20).
The slope tells us that Peter runs 5 feet every one second, so another point on the line is (1, 25). Connecting
these points gives us Peter’s line:


In order to ﬁnd when and where Nadia and Peter meet, we’ll graph both lines on the same graph and
extend the lines until they cross. The crossing point is the solution to this problem.


The graph shows that Nadia and Peter meet 20 seconds after Nadia starts running, and 120 feet
from the starting point.
These examples are great at demonstrating that the solution to a system of linear equations means the


point at which the lines intersect. This is, in fact, the greatest strength of the graphing method because it
oﬀers a very visual representation of system of equations and its solution. You can also see, though, that
ﬁnding the solution from a graph requires very careful graphing of the lines, and is really only practical
when you’re sure that the solution gives integer values for x and y. Usually, this method can only oﬀer
approximate solutions to systems of equations, so we need to use other methods to get an exact solution.

Introduction
In this lesson, we’ll learn to solve a system of two equations using the method of substitution.


Solving Linear Systems Using Substitution of Variable Expres-
sions
Let’s look again at the problem about Peter and Nadia racing.
Peter and Nadia like to race each other. Peter can run at a speed of 5 feet per second and Nadia can run
at a speed of 6 feet per second. To be a good sport, Nadia likes to give Peter a head start of 20 feet. How
long does Nadia take to catch up with Peter? At what distance from the start does Nadia catch up with
Peter?
In that example we came up with two equations:
Nadia’s equation: d = 6t
Peter’s equation: d = 5t + 20
Each equation produced its own line on a graph, and to solve the system we found the point at which the
lines intersected—the point where the values for d and t satisﬁed both relationships. When the values for
d and t are equal, that means that Peter and Nadia are at the same place at the same time.
But there’s a faster way than graphing to solve this system of equations. Since we want the value of d to
be the same in both equations, we could just set the two right-hand sides of the equations equal to each
other to solve for t. That is, if d = 6t and d = 5t + 20, and the two d’s are equal to each other, then by the
transitive property we have 6t = 5t + 20. We can solve this for t:

               6t = 5t + 20                   subtract 5t f rom both sides :
                t = 20                        substitute this value f or t into Nadia’s equation :
               d = 6 · 20 = 120

Even if the equations weren’t so obvious, we could use simple algebraic manipulation to ﬁnd an expression
for one variable in terms of the other. If we rearrange Peter’s equation to isolate t:

                           d = 5t + 20                     subtract 20 f rom both sides :
                     d − 20 = 5t                           divide by 5 :
                     d − 20
                            =t

We can now substitute this expression for t into Nadia’s equation (d = 6t) to solve:

                   (       )
                d − 20
            d=6                                   multiply both sides by 5 :
           5d = 6(d − 20)                         distribute the 6 :
           5d = 6d − 120                          subtract 6d f rom both sides :
           −d = −120                              divide by − 1 :
            d = 120                               substitute value f or d into our expression f or t :
                120 − 20   100
            t=           =     = 20
                    5       5

So we ﬁnd that Nadia and Peter meet 20 seconds after they start racing, at a distance of 120 feet away.
The method we just used is called the Substitution Method. In this lesson you’ll learn several techniques
for isolating variables in a system of equations, and for using those expressions to solve systems of equations
that describe situations like this one.

**Example 1**

Let’s look at an example where the equations are written in standard form.
Solve the system

                                                 2x + 3y = 6
                                                 −4x + y = 2

Again, we start by looking to isolate one variable in either equation. If you look at the second equation,
you should see that the coeﬀicient of y is 1. So the easiest way to start is to use this equation to solve for
y.
Solve the second equation for y:

                         −4x + y = 2                              add 4x to both sides :
                                 y = 2 + 4x

Substitute this expression into the ﬁrst equation:

                       2x + 3(2 + 4x) = 6                     distribute the 3 :
                        2x + 6 + 12x = 6                      collect like terms :
                               14x + 6 = 6                    subtract 6 f rom both sides :
                                  14x = 0                     and hence :
                                     x=0

Substitute back into our expression for y:

                                               y=2+4·0=2

As you can see, we end up with the same solution (x = 0, y = 2) that we found when we graphed these
functions back in Lesson 7.1. So long as you are careful with the algebra, the substitution method can be
a very eﬀicient way to solve systems.
Next, let’s look at a more complicated example. Here, the values of x and y we end up with aren’t whole
numbers, so they would be diﬀicult to read oﬀ a graph!


**Example 2**

Solve the system
                                                2x + 3y = 3
                                                 2x − 3y = −1

Again, we start by looking to isolate one variable in either equation. In this case it doesn’t matter which
equation we use—all the variables look about equally easy to solve for.
So let’s solve the ﬁrst equation for x:

                    2x + 3y = 3                               subtract 3y f rom both sides :
                         2x = 3 − 3y                          divide both sides by 2 :
                          x = (3 − 3y)
Substitute this expression into the second equation:
               2 · (3 − 3y) − 3y = −1                cancel the f raction and re − write terms :
                      3 − 3y − 3y = −1                collect like terms :
                          3 − 6y = −1                 subtract 3 f rom both sides :
                             −6y = −4                 divide by − 6 :
                               y=
Substitute into the expression we got for x:
                                                  1(        ( 2 ))
                                               x=    3 − 3
                                                  2           3
                                               x=
                                                                              (          )
So our solution is x = 12 , y = 23 . You can see how the graphical solution       2, 3
                                                                                  1 2
                                                                                             might have been diﬀicult to
read accurately oﬀ a graph!


Solving Real-World Problems Using Linear Systems
Simultaneous equations can help us solve many real-world problems. We may be considering a pur-
chase—for example, trying to decide whether it’s cheaper to buy an item online where you pay shipping
or at the store where you do not. Or you may wish to join a CD music club, but aren’t sure if you would
really save any money by buying a new CD every month in that way. Or you might be considering two
diﬀerent phone contracts. Let’s look at an example of that now.

**Example 3**

Anne is trying to choose between two phone plans. The ﬁrst plan, with Vendafone, costs $20 per month,
with calls costing an additional 25 cents per minute. The second company, Sellnet, charges $40 per month,
but calls cost only 8 cents per minute. Which should she choose?
You should see that Anne’s choice will depend upon how many minutes of calls she expects to use each
month. We start by writing two equations for the cost in dollars in terms of the minutes used. Since the
number of minutes is the independent variable, it will be our x. Cost is dependent on minutes – the cost
per month is the dependent variable and will be assigned y.

For Vendafone: y = 0.25x + 20
For Sellnet: y = 0.08x + 40
By writing the equations in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), you can sketch a graph to visualize the
situation:


The line for Vendafone has an intercept of 20 and a slope of 0.25. The Sellnet line has an intercept of 40
and a slope of 0.08 (which is roughly a third of the Vendafone line’s slope). In order to help Anne decide
which to choose, we’ll ﬁnd where the two lines cross, by solving the two equations as a system.
Since equation 1 gives us an expression for y(0.25x + 20), we can substitute this expression directly into
equation 2:
               0.25x + 20 = 0.08x + 40                     subtract 20 f rom both sides :
                    0.25x = 0.08x + 20                     subtract 0.08x f rom both sides :
                    0.17x = 20                             divide both sides by 0.17 :
                         x = 117.65 minutes                rounded to 2 decimal places.

So if Anne uses 117.65 minutes a month (although she can’t really do exactly that, because phone plans
only count whole numbers of minutes), the phone plans will cost the same. Now we need to look at the
graph to see which plan is better if she uses more minutes than that, and which plan is better if she uses
fewer. You can see that the Vendafone plan costs more when she uses more minutes, and the Sellnet plan
costs more with fewer minutes.
So, if Anne will use 117 minutes or less every month she should choose Vendafone. If she
plans on using 118 or more minutes she should choose Sellnet.


Mixture Problems
Systems of equations crop up frequently in problems that deal with mixtures of two things—chemicals in
a solution, nuts and raisins, or even the change in your pocket! Let’s look at some examples of these.

**Example 4**

Janine empties her purse and ﬁnds that it contains only nickels (worth 5 cents each) and dimes (worth 10
cents each). If she has a total of 7 coins and they have a combined value of 45 cents, how many of each
coin does she have?
Since we have 2 types of coins, let’s call the number of nickels x and the number of dimes y. We are given
two key pieces of information to make our equations: the number of coins and their value.
       # of coins equation:        x+y=7                 (number o f nickels) + (number o f dimes)
       value equation:             5x + 10y = 55         (since nickels are worth 5c and dimes 10c)

We can quickly rearrange the ﬁrst equation to isolate x:

                   x=7−y                                   now substitute into equation 2 :
                   5(7 − y) + 10y = 55                     distribute the 5 :
                   35 − 5y + 10y = 55                      collect like terms :
                   35 + 5y = 55                            subtract 35 f rom both sides :
                   5y = 20                                 divide by 5 :
                   y=4                                     substitute back into equation 1 :
                   x+4=7                                   subtract 4 f rom both sides :
                   x=3

Janine has 3 nickels and 4 dimes.
Sometimes a question asks you to determine (from concentrations) how much of a particular substance
to use. The substance in question could be something like coins as above, or it could be a chemical in
solution, or even heat. In such a case, you need to know the amount of whatever substance is in each part.
There are several common situations where to get one equation you simply add two given quantities, but
to get the second equation you need to use a product. Three examples are below.

                                                 Table 7.5:

 Type of mixture                      First equation                        Second equation
 Coins (items with $ value)           total number of items (n1 + n2 )      total value (item value × no. of
                                                                            items)
 Chemical solutions                   total solution volume (V1 + V2 )      amount of solute (vol × concen-
                                                                            tration)
 Density of two substances            total amount or volume of mix         total mass (volume × density)


For example, when considering mixing chemical solutions, we will most likely need to consider the total
amount of solute in the individual parts and in the ﬁnal mixture. (A solute is the chemical that is dissolved
in a solution. An example of a solute is salt when added to water to make a brine.) To ﬁnd the total
amount, simply multiply the amount of the mixture by the fractional concentration. To illustrate, let’s
look at an example where you are given amounts relative to the whole.

**Example 5**

A chemist needs to prepare 500 ml of copper-sulfate solution with a 15% concentration. She wishes to use
a high concentration solution (60%) and dilute it with a low concentration solution (5%) in order to do
this. How much of each solution should she use?

**Solution:**

To set this problem up, we ﬁrst need to deﬁne our variables. Our unknowns are the amount of concentrated
solution (x) and the amount of dilute solution (y). We will also convert the percentages (60%, 15% and
5%) into decimals (0.6, 0.15 and 0.05). The two pieces of critical information are the ﬁnal volume (500 ml)
and the ﬁnal amount of solute (15% of 500 ml = 75 ml). Our equations will look like this:
Volume equation: x + y = 500
Solute equation: 0.6x + 0.05y = 75
To isolate a variable for substitution, we can see it’s easier to start with equation 1:

               x + y = 500                             subtract y f rom both sides :
               x = 500 − y                             now substitute into equation 2 :
               0.6(500 − y) + 0.05y = 75               distribute the 0.6 :
               300 − 0.6y + 0.05y = 75                 collect like terms :
               300 − 0.55y = 75                        subtract 300 f rom both sides :
               − 0.55y = −225                          divide both sides by − 0.55 :
               y = 409 ml                              substitute back into equation f or x :
               x = 500 − 409 = 91 ml


So the chemist should mix 91 ml of the 60% solution with 409 ml of the 5% solution.

## 7.3 Solving Linear Systems by Elimination


### Learning Objectives

- Solve a linear system of equations using elimination by addition.
- Solve a linear system of equations using elimination by subtraction.
- Solve a linear system of equations by multiplication and then addition or subtraction.
- Compare methods for solving linear systems.
- Solve real-world problems using linear systems by any method.


Introduction
In this lesson, we’ll see how to use simple addition and subtraction to simplify our system of equations
to a single equation involving a single variable. Because we go from two unknowns (x and y) to a single
unknown (either x or y), this method is often referred to by solving by elimination. We eliminate one
variable in order to make our equations solvable! To illustrate this idea, let’s look at the simple example
of buying apples and bananas.

**Example 1**

If one apple plus one banana costs $1.25 and one apple plus 2 bananas costs $2.00, how much does one
banana cost? One apple?
It shouldn’t take too long to discover that each banana costs $0.75. After all, the second purchase just
contains 1 more banana than the ﬁrst, and costs $0.75 more, so that one banana must cost $0.75.
Here’s what we get when we describe this situation with algebra:

                                               a + b = 1.25
                                              a + 2b = 2.00

Now we can subtract the number of apples and bananas in the ﬁrst equation from the number in the second
equation, and also subtract the cost in the ﬁrst equation from the cost in the second equation, to get the
diﬀerence in cost that corresponds to the diﬀerence in items purchased.

                               (a + 2b) − (a + b) = 2.00 − 1.25 → b = 0.75

That gives us the cost of one banana. To ﬁnd out how much one apple costs, we subtract $0.75 from the
total cost of one apple and one banana.

                              a + 0.75 = 1.25 → a = 1.25 − 0.75 → a = 0.50

So an apple costs 50 cents.
To solve systems using addition and subtraction, we’ll be using exactly this idea – by looking at the sum
or diﬀerence of the two equations we can determine a value for one of the unknowns.

Solving Linear Systems Using Addition of Equations
Often considered the easiest and most powerful method of solving systems of equations, the addition (or
elimination) method lets us combine two equations in such a way that the resulting equation has only one
variable. We can then use simple algebra to solve for that variable. Then, if we need to, we can substitute
the value we get for that variable back into either one of the original equations to solve for the other
variable.

**Example 2**

Solve this system by addition:

                                                 3x + 2y = 11
                                                 5x − 2y = 13


**Solution:**

We will add everything on the left of the equals sign from both equations, and this will be equal to the
sum of everything on the right:

                             (3x + 2y) + (5x − 2y) = 11 + 13 → 8x = 24 → x = 3

A simpler way to visualize this is to keep the equations as they appear above, and to add them together
vertically, going down the columns. However, just like when you add units, tens and hundreds, you MUST
be sure to keep the x’s and y’s in their own columns. You may also wish to use terms like “0y” as a
placeholder!

                                                  3x + 2y = 11
                                             + (5x − 2y) = 13
                                                  8x + 0y = 24

Again we get 8x = 24, or x = 3. To ﬁnd a value for y, we simply substitute our value for x back in.
Substitute x = 3 into the second equation:

               5 · 3 − 2y = 13               since 5 × 3 = 15, we subtract 15 f rom both sides :
                    −2y = −2                 divide by − 2 to get :
                       y=1

The reason this method worked is that the y−coeﬀicients of the two equations were opposites of each other:
2 and -2. Because they were opposites, they canceled each other out when we added the two equations
together, so our ﬁnal equation had no y−term in it and we could just solve it for x.
In a little while we’ll see how to use the addition method when the coeﬀicients are not opposites, but for
now let’s look at another example where they are.

**Example 3**

Andrew is paddling his canoe down a fast-moving river. Paddling downstream he travels at 7 miles per
hour, relative to the river bank. Paddling upstream, he moves slower, traveling at 1.5 miles per hour. If
he paddles equally hard in both directions, how fast is the current? How fast would Andrew travel in calm
water?

**Solution:**


First we convert our problem into equations. We have two unknowns to solve for, so we’ll call the speed
that Andrew paddles at x, and the speed of the river y. When traveling downstream, Andrew speed is
boosted by the river current, so his total speed is his paddling speed plus the speed of the river (x + y).
Traveling upstream, the river is working against him, so his total speed is his paddling speed minus the
speed of the river (x − y).
Downstream Equation: x + y = 7
Upstream Equation: x − y = 1.5
Next we’ll eliminate one of the variables. If you look at the two equations, you can see that the coeﬀicient
of y is +1 in the ﬁrst equation and -1 in the second. Clearly (+1) + (−1) = 0, so this is the variable we will
eliminate. To do this we simply add equation 1 to equation 2. We must be careful to collect like terms,
and make sure that everything on the left of the equals sign stays on the left, and everything on the right
stays on the right:

                             (x + y) + (x − y) = 7 + 1.5 ⇒ 2x = 8.5 ⇒ x = 4.25

Or, using the column method we used in example 2:

                                                    x+y=7
                                                 + x − y = 1.5
                                                  2x + 0y = 8.5

Again we get 2x = 8.5, or x = 4.25. To ﬁnd a corresponding value for y, we plug our value for x into either
equation and isolate our unknown. In this example, we’ll plug it into the ﬁrst equation:

                     4.25 + y = 7                         subtract 4.25 f rom both sides :
                            y = 2.75

Andrew paddles at 4.25 miles per hour. The river moves at 2.75 miles per hour.


Solving Linear Systems Using Subtraction of Equations
Another, very similar method for solving systems is subtraction. When the x− or y−coeﬀicients in both
equations are the same (including the sign) instead of being opposites, you can subtract one equation
from the other.
If you look again at Example 3, you can see that the coeﬀicient for x in both equations is +1. Instead of
adding the two equations together to get rid of the y’s, you could have subtracted to get rid of the x’s:

                             (x + y) − (x − y) = 7 − 1.5 ⇒ 2y = 5.5 ⇒ y = 2.75
                                    or...
                                      x+y=7
                               − (x − y) = −1.5
                                 0x + 2y = 5.5

So again we get y = 2.75, and we can plug that back in to determine x.
The method of subtraction is just as straightforward as addition, so long as you remember the following:

- Always put the equation you are subtracting in parentheses, and distribute the negative.
- Don’t forget to subtract the numbers on the right-hand side.
- Always remember that subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive.


**Example 4**

Peter examines the coins in the fountain at the mall. He counts 107 coins, all of which are either pennies
or nickels. The total value of the coins is $3.47. How many of each coin did he see?

**Solution:**

We have 2 types of coins, so let’s call the number of pennies x and the number of nickels y. The total value
of all the pennies is just x, since they are worth 1c each. The total value of the nickels is 5y. We are given
two key pieces of information to make our equations: the number of coins and their value in cents.

       # of coins equation :         x + y = 107          (number o f pennies) + (number o f nickels)
       value equation :              x + 5y = 347         pennies are worth 1c, nickels are worth 5c.

We’ll jump straight to subtracting the two equations:

                                                    x + y = 107
                                             − (x + 5y) = −347
                                                    − 4y = −240
                                                        y = 60

Substituting this value back into the ﬁrst equation:

                      x + 60 = 107                        subtract 60 f rom both sides :
                            x = 47

So Peter saw 47 pennies (worth 47 cents) and 60 nickels (worth $3.00) making a total of
$3.47.


Solving Linear Systems Using Multiplication
So far, we’ve seen that the elimination method works well when the coeﬀicient of one variable happens to
be the same (or opposite) in the two equations. But what if the two equations don’t have any coeﬀicients
the same?
It turns out that we can still use the elimination method; we just have to make one of the coeﬀicients
match. We can accomplish this by multiplying one or both of the equations by a constant.
Here’s a quick review of how to do that. Consider the following questions:

  1. If 10 apples cost $5, how much would 30 apples cost?
  2. If 3 bananas plus 2 carrots cost $4, how mush would 6 bananas plus 4 carrots cost?

If you look at the ﬁrst equation, it should be obvious that each apple costs $0.50. So 30 apples should cost
$15.00.
The second equation is trickier; it isn’t obvious what the individual price for either bananas or carrots is.
Yet we know that the answer to question 2 is $8.00. How?

If we look again at question 1, we see that we can write an equation: 10a = 5 (a being the cost of 1 apple).
So to ﬁnd the cost of 30 apples, we could solve for a and then multiply by 30—but we could also just
multiply both sides of the equation by 3. We would get 30a = 15, and that tells us that 30 apples cost $15.
And we can do the same thing with the second question. The equation for this situation is 3b + 2c = 4,
and we can see that we need to solve for (6b + 4c), which is simply 2 times (3b + 2c)! So algebraically, we
are simply multiplying the entire equation by 2:

                      2(3b + 2c) = 2 · 4                           distribute and multiply :
                          6b + 4c = 8

So when we multiply an equation, all we are doing is multiplying every term in the equation by a ﬁxed
amount.


Solving a Linear System by Multiplying One Equation
If we can multiply every term in an equation by a ﬁxed number (a scalar), that means we can use the
addition method on a whole new set of linear systems. We can manipulate the equations in a system to
ensure that the coeﬀicients of one of the variables match.
This is easiest to do when the coeﬀicient as a variable in one equation is a multiple of the coeﬀicient in the
other equation.

**Example 5**

Solve the system:

                                                    7x + 4y = 17
                                                    5x − 2y = 11


**Solution:**

You can easily see that if we multiply the second equation by 2, the coeﬀicients of y will be +4 and -4,
allowing us to solve the system by addition:
2 times equation 2:

                                    10x − 4y = 22                      now add to equation one :
                                 + (7x + 4y) = 17
                                         17x = 34


                divide by 17 to get :      x=2

Now simply substitute this value for x back into equation 1:

               7 · 2 + 4y = 17                 since 7 × 2 = 14, subtract 14 f rom both sides :
                      4y = 3                   divide by 4 :
                       y = 0.75


**Example 6**

Anne is rowing her boat along a river. Rowing downstream, it takes her 2 minutes to cover 400 yards.
Rowing upstream, it takes her 8 minutes to travel the same 400 yards. If she was rowing equally hard in

both directions, calculate, in yards per minute, the speed of the river and the speed Anne would travel in
calm water.

**Solution:**

Step one: ﬁrst we convert our problem into equations. We know that distance traveled is equal to speed
× time. We have two unknowns, so we’ll call the speed of the river x, and the speed that Anne rows at
y. When traveling downstream, her total speed is her rowing speed plus the speed of the river, or (x + y).
Going upstream, her speed is hindered by the speed of the river, so her speed upstream is (x − y).
Downstream Equation: 2(x + y) = 400
Upstream Equation: 8(x − y) = 400
Distributing gives us the following system:

                                                2x + 2y = 400
                                                8x − 8y = 400

Right now, we can’t use the method of elimination because none of the coeﬀicients match. But if we
multiplied the top equation by 4, the coeﬀicients of y would be +8 and -8. Let’s do that:

                                                  8x + 8y = 1, 600
                                              + (8x − 8y) = 400
                                                      16x = 2, 000

Now we divide by 16 to obtain x = 125.
Substitute this value back into the ﬁrst equation:

                    2(125 + y) = 400                       divide both sides by 2 :
                       125 + y = 200                       subtract 125 f rom both sides :
                             y = 75

Anne rows at 125 yards per minute, and the river ﬂows at 75 yards per minute.


Solving a Linear System by Multiplying Both Equations
So what do we do if none of the coeﬀicients match and none of them are simple multiples of each other? We
do the same thing we do when we’re adding fractions whose denominators aren’t simple multiples of each
other. Remember that when we add fractions, we have to ﬁnd a lowest common denominator—that
is, the lowest common multiple of the two denominators—and sometimes we have to rewrite not just one,
but both fractions to get them to have a common denominator. Similarly, sometimes we have to multiply
both equations by diﬀerent constants in order to get one of the coeﬀicients to match.

**Example 7**

Andrew and Anne both use the I-Haul truck rental company to move their belongings from home to the
dorm rooms on the University of Chicago campus. I-Haul has a charge per day and an additional charge
per mile. Andrew travels from San Diego, California, a distance of 2060 miles in ﬁve days. Anne travels
880 miles from Norfolk, Virginia, and it takes her three days. If Anne pays $840 and Andrew pays $1845,
what does I-Haul charge
a) per day?

b) per mile traveled?

**Solution:**

First, we’ll set up our equations. Again we have 2 unknowns: the daily rate (we’ll call this x), and the
per-mile rate (we’ll call this y).
Anne’s equation: 3x + 880y = 840
Andrew’s Equation: 5x + 2060y = 1845
We can’t just multiply a single equation by an integer number in order to arrive at matching coeﬀicients.
But if we look at the coeﬀicients of x (as they are easier to deal with than the coeﬀicients of y), we see
that they both have a common multiple of 15 (in fact 15 is the lowest common multiple). So we can
multiply both equations.
Multiply the top equation by 5:

                                              15x + 4400y = 4200

Multiply the lower equation by 3:

                                              15x + 6180y = 5535

Subtract:

                                                15x + 4400y = 4200
                                        − (15x + 6180y) = 5535
                                                    − 1780y = −1335


                                     Divide by − 1780 : y = 0.75

Substitute this back into the top equation:

            3x + 880(0.75) = 840          since 880 × 0.75 = 660, subtract 660 f rom both sides :
                        3x = 180          divide both sides by 3
                         x = 60

I-Haul charges $60 per day plus $0.75 per mile.


Comparing Methods for Solving Linear Systems
Now that we’ve covered the major methods for solving linear equations, let’s review them. For simplicity,
we’ll look at them in table form. This should help you decide which method would be best for a given
situation.

The table above is only a guide. You might prefer to use the graphical method for every system in order
to better understand what is happening, or you might prefer to use the multiplication method even when
a substitution would work just as well.

**Example 8**

Two angles are complementary when the sum of their angles is 90◦ . Angles A and B are complementary
angles, and twice the measure of angle A is 9◦ more than three times the measure of angle B. Find the
measure of each angle.

**Solution:**

First we write out our 2 equations. We will use x to be the measure of angle A and y to be the measure of
angle B. We get the following system:

                                               x + y = 90
                                                   2x = 3y + 9

First, we’ll solve this system with the graphical method. For this, we need to convert the two equations to
y = mx + b form:

                                      x + y = 90         ⇒ y = −x + 90
                                      2x = 3y + 9        ⇒y= x−3

The ﬁrst line has a slope of -1 and a y−intercept of 90, and the second line has a slope of 23 and a y−intercept
of -3. The graph looks like this:


In the graph, it appears that the lines cross at around x = 55, y = 35, but it is diﬀicult to tell exactly!
Graphing by hand is not the best method in this case!
Next, we’ll try solving by substitution. Let’s look again at the system:

                                                x + y = 90
                                                    2x = 3y + 9

We’ve already seen that we can start by solving either equation for y, so let’s start with the ﬁrst one:

                                                    y = 90 − x

Substitute into the second equation:

                       2x = 3(90 − x) + 9                          distribute the 3 :
                       2x = 270 − 3x + 9                           add 3x to both sides :
                       5x = 270 + 9 = 279                          divide by 5 :
                               ◦
                       x = 55.8

Substitute back into our expression for y:

                                             y = 90 − 55.8 = 34.2◦

Angle A measures 55.8◦ ; angle B measures 34.2◦ .
Finally, we’ll try solving by elimination (with multiplication):
Rearrange equation one to standard form:

                                       x + y = 90       ⇒ 2x + 2y = 180

Multiply equation two by 2:

                                       2x = 3y + 9        ⇒ 2x − 3y = 9

Subtract:

                                                         2x + 2y = 180
                                                    − (2x − 3y) = −9


                                                               5y = 171


                                          Divide by 5 to obtain y = 34.2◦

Substitute this value into the very ﬁrst equation:

                    x + 34.2 = 90                             subtract 34.2 f rom both sides :
                                      ◦
                           x = 55.8

Angle A measures 55.8◦ ; angle B measures 34.2◦ .
Even though this system looked ideal for substitution, the method of multiplication worked well too. Once
the equations were rearranged properly, the solution was quick to ﬁnd. You’ll need to decide yourself which
method to use in each case you see from now on. Try to master all the techniques, and recognize which
one will be most eﬀicient for each system you are asked to solve.

## 7.4 Special Types of Linear Systems


### Learning Objectives


- Identify and understand what is meant by an inconsistent linear system.
- Identify and understand what is meant by a consistent linear system.
- Identify and understand what is meant by a dependent linear system.


Introduction

As we saw in Section 7.1, a system of linear equations is a set of linear equations which must be solved
together. The lines in the system can be graphed together on the same coordinate graph and the solution
to the system is the point at which the two lines intersect.
Or at least that’s what usually happens. But what if the lines turn out to be parallel when we graph them?


If the lines are parallel, they won’t ever intersect. That means that the system of equations they represent
has no solution. A system with no solutions is called an inconsistent system.
And what if the lines turn out to be identical?

If the two lines are the same, then every point on one line is also on the other line, so every point on the
line is a solution to the system. The system has an inﬁnite number of solutions, and the two equations
are really just diﬀerent forms of the same equation. Such a system is called a dependent system.
But usually, two lines cross at exactly one point and the system has exactly one solution:


A system with exactly one solution is called a consistent system.
To identify a system as consistent, inconsistent, or dependent, we can graph the two lines on the same
graph and see if they intersect, are parallel, or are the same line. But sometimes it is hard to tell whether
two lines are parallel just by looking at a roughly sketched graph.
Another option is to write each line in slope-intercept form and compare the slopes and y− intercepts of
the two lines. To do this we must remember that:

- Lines with diﬀerent slopes always intersect.
- Lines with the same slope but diﬀerent y−intercepts are parallel.
- Lines with the same slope and the same y−intercepts are identical.


**Example 1**

Determine whether the following system has exactly one solution, no solutions, or an inﬁnite number of
solutions.

                                                2x − 5y = 2
                                                 4x + y = 5


**Solution:**

We must rewrite the equations so they are in slope-intercept form
2x − 5y = 2                   − 5y = −2x + 2                     y = 25 x − 52
                    ⇒                                  ⇒
4x + y = 5                      y = −4x + 5                       y = −4x + 5

The slopes of the two equations are diﬀerent; therefore the lines must cross at a single point and the system
has exactly one solution. This is a consistent system.

**Example 2**

Determine whether the following system has exactly one solution, no solutions, or an inﬁnite number of
solutions.

                                                    3x = 5 − 4y
                                                6x + 8y = 7


**Solution:**

We must rewrite the equations so they are in slope-intercept form
3x = 5 − 4y                     4y = −3x + 5                      y = − 34 x + 45
                    ⇒                                   ⇒
6x + 8y = 7                        8y = −6x + 7                   y = − 34 x + 87
The slopes of the two equations are the same but the y−intercepts are diﬀerent; therefore the lines are
parallel and the system has no solutions. This is an inconsistent system.

**Example 3**

Determine whether the following system has exactly one solution, no solutions, or an inﬁnite number of
solutions.

                                                    x+y=3
                                                  3x + 3y = 9


**Solution:**

We must rewrite the equations so they are in slope-intercept form
x+y=3                              y = −x + 3                        y = −x + 3
                    ⇒                                   ⇒
3x + 3y = 9                        3y = −3x + 9                      y = −x + 3
The lines are identical; therefore the system has an inﬁnite number of solutions. It is a dependent
system.


Determining the Type of System Algebraically
A third option for identifying systems as consistent, inconsistent or dependent is to just solve the system
and use the result as a guide.

**Example 4**

Solve the following system of equations. Identify the system as consistent, inconsistent or dependent.

                                                  10x − 3y = 3
                                                   2x + y = 9


**Solution:**

Let’s solve this system using the substitution method.
Solve the second equation for y:

                                             2x + y = 9 ⇒ y = −2x + 9

Substitute that expression for y in the ﬁrst equation:

                                                         10x − 3y = 3
                                              10x − 3(−2x + 9) = 3
                                                    10x + 6x − 27 = 3
                                                             16x = 30
                                                               x=

Substitute the value of x back into the second equation and solve for y:
                                                                        15       21
                          2x + y = 9 ⇒ y = −2x + 9 ⇒ y = −2 ·              +9⇒y=
                                                                         8       4
                                (        )
                                     8 , 4 . The system is consistent since it has only one solution.
                                    15 21
The solution to the system is

**Example 5**

Solve the following system of equations. Identify the system as consistent, inconsistent or dependent.

                                                      3x − 2y = 4
                                                      9x − 6y = 1


**Solution:**

Let’s solve this system by the method of multiplication.
Multiply the ﬁrst equation by 3:
3(3x − 2y = 4)                       9x − 6y = 12
                   ⇒
9x − 6y = 1                          9x − 6y = 1
Add the two equations:

                                       9x − 6y = 4
                                       9x − 6y = 1
                                             0 = 13     This statement is not true.

If our solution to a system turns out to be a statement that is not true, then the system doesn’t really
have a solution; it is inconsistent.

**Example 6**

Solve the following system of equations. Identify the system as consistent, inconsistent or dependent.

                                                       4x + y = 3
                                                     12x + 3y = 9


**Solution:**


Let’s solve this system by substitution.
Solve the ﬁrst equation for y:

                                           4x + y = 3 ⇒ y = −4x + 3

Substitute this expression for y in the second equation:

                                                     12x + 3y = 9
                                             12x + 3(−4x + 3) = 9
                                                12x − 12x + 9 = 9
                                                           9=9

This statement is always true.
If our solution to a system turns out to be a statement that is always true, then the system is dependent.
A second glance at the system in this example reveals that the second equation is three times the ﬁrst
equation, so the two lines are identical. The system has an inﬁnite number of solutions because they are
really the same equation and trace out the same line.
Let’s clarify this statement. An inﬁnite number of solutions does not mean that any ordered pair (x, y)
satisﬁes the system of equations. Only ordered pairs that solve the equation in the system (either one of
the equations) are also solutions to the system. There are inﬁnitely many of these solutions to the system
because there are inﬁnitely many points on any one line.
For example, (1, -1) is a solution to the system in this example, and so is (-1, 7). Each of them ﬁts both
the equations because both equations are really the same equation. But (3, 5) doesn’t ﬁt either equation
and is not a solution to the system.
In fact, for every x−value there is just one y−value that ﬁts both equations, and for every y−value there is
exactly one x−value—just as there is for a single line.
Let’s summarize how to determine the type of system we are dealing with algebraically.

- A consistent system will always give exactly one solution.
- An inconsistent system will yield a statement that is always false (like 0 = 13).
- A dependent system will yield a statement that is always true (like 9 = 9).


Applications
In this section, we’ll see how consistent, inconsistent and dependent systems might arise in real life.

**Example 7**

The movie rental store CineStar oﬀers customers two choices. Customers can pay a yearly membership of
$45 and then rent each movie for $2 or they can choose not to pay the membership fee and rent each movie
for $3.50. How many movies would you have to rent before the membership becomes the cheaper option?

**Solution:**

Let’s translate this problem into algebra. Since there are two diﬀerent options to consider, we can write
two diﬀerent equations and form a system.
The choices are “membership” and “no membership.” We’ll call the number of movies you rent x and the
total cost of renting movies for a year y.


                                                Table 7.7:

                              ﬂat fee                   rental fee                 total
 membership                   $45                       2x                         y = 45 + 2x
 no membership                $0                        3.50x                      y = 3.5x


The ﬂat fee is the dollar amount you pay per year and the rental fee is the dollar amount you pay when
you rent a movie. For the membership option the rental fee is 2x, since you would pay $2 for each movie
you rented; for the no membership option the rental fee is 3.50x, since you would pay $3.50 for each movie
you rented.
Our system of equations is:
y = 45 + 2x
y = 3.50x
Here’s a graph of the system:


Now we need to ﬁnd the exact intersection point. Since each equation is already solved for y, we can easily
solve the system with substitution. Substitute the second equation into the ﬁrst one:
y = 45 + 2x
                ⇒ 3.50x = 45 + 2x ⇒ 1.50x = 45 ⇒ x = 30 movies
y = 3.50x
You would have to rent 30 movies per year before the membership becomes the better option.
This example shows a real situation where a consistent system of equations is useful in ﬁnding a solution.
Remember that for a consistent system, the lines that make up the system intersect at single point. In
other words, the lines are not parallel or the slopes are diﬀerent.
In this case, the slopes of the lines represent the price of a rental per movie. The lines cross because the
price of rental per movie is diﬀerent for the two options in the problem
Now let’s look at a situation where the system is inconsistent. From the previous explanation, we can
conclude that the lines will not intersect if the slopes are the same (and the y−intercept is diﬀerent). Let’s
change the previous problem so that this is the case.

**Example 8**

Two movie rental stores are in competition. Movie House charges an annual membership of $30 and
charges $3 per movie rental. Flicks for Cheap charges an annual membership of $15 and charges $3 per

movie rental. After how many movie rentals would Movie House become the better option?

**Solution:**

It should already be clear to see that Movie House will never become the better option, since its membership
is more expensive and it charges the same amount per movie as Flicks for Cheap.
The lines on a graph that describe each option have diﬀerent y−intercepts—namely 30 for Movie House and
15 for Flicks for Cheap—but the same slope: 3 dollars per movie. This means that the lines are parallel
and so the system is inconsistent.
Now let’s see how this works algebraically. Once again, we’ll call the number of movies you rent x and the
total cost of renting movies for a year y.

                                                Table 7.8:

                            ﬂat fee                    rental fee                 total
 Movie House                $30                        3x                         y = 30 + 3x
 Flicks for Cheap           $15                        3x                         y = 15 + 3x


The system of equations that describes this problem is:
y = 30 + 3x
y = 15 + 3x
Let’s solve this system by substituting the second equation into the ﬁrst equation:
y = 30 + 3x
                  ⇒ 15 + 3x = 30 + 3x ⇒ 15 = 30       This statement is always false.
y = 15 + 3x
This means that the system is inconsistent.

**Example 9**

Peter buys two apples and three bananas for $4. Nadia buys four apples and six bananas for $8 from the
same store. How much does one banana and one apple costs?

**Solution:**

We must write two equations: one for Peter’s purchase and one for Nadia’s purchase.
Let’s say a is the cost of one apple and b is the cost of one banana.

                                                Table 7.9:

                            cost of apples             cost of bananas            total cost
 Peter                      2a                         3b                         2a + 3b = 4
 Nadia                      4a                         6b                         4a + 6b = 8


The system of equations that describes this problem is:
2a + 3b = 4
4a + 6b = 8
Let’s solve this system by multiplying the ﬁrst equation by -2 and adding the two equations:
−2(2a + 3b = 4)             − 4a − 6b = −8

                      ⇒
4a + 6b = 8                   4a + 6b = 8
                               0+0=0
This statement is always true. This means that the system is dependent.
Looking at the problem again, we can see that we were given exactly the same information in both
statements. If Peter buys two apples and three bananas for $4, it makes sense that if Nadia buys twice
as many apples (four apples) and twice as many bananas (six bananas) she will pay twice the price ($8).
Since the second equation doesn’t give us any new information, it doesn’t make it possible to ﬁnd out the
price of each fruit.

## 7.5 Systems of Linear Inequalities


### Learning Objectives

- Graph linear inequalities in two variables.
- Solve systems of linear inequalities.
- Solve optimization problems.


Introduction
In the last chapter you learned how to graph a linear inequality in two variables. To do that, you graphed
the equation of the straight line on the coordinate plane. The line was solid for ≤ or ≥ signs (where the
equals sign is included), and the line was dashed for < or > signs (where the equals sign is not included).
Then you shaded above the line (if the inequality began with y > or y ≥) or below the line (if it began with
y < or y ≤).
In this section, we’ll see how to graph two or more linear inequalities on the same coordinate plane. The
inequalities are graphed separately on the same graph, and the solution for the system is the common

shaded region between all the inequalities in the system. One linear inequality in two variables divides the
plane into two half-planes. A system of two or more linear inequalities can divide the plane into more
complex shapes.
Let’s start by solving a system of two inequalities.


Graph a System of Two Linear Inequalities

**Example 1**

Solve the following system:


                                                  2x + 3y ≤ 18
                                                   x − 4y ≤ 12


**Solution:**

Solving systems of linear inequalities means graphing and ﬁnding the intersections. So we graph each
inequality, and then ﬁnd the intersection regions of the solution.
First, let’s rewrite each equation in slope-intercept form. (Remember that this form makes it easier to tell
which region of the coordinate plane to shade.) Our system becomes
3y ≤ −2x + 18                    y ≤ − 23 x + 6
                      ⇒
− 4y ≤ −x + 12                   y ≥ 4x − 3
Notice that the inequality sign in the second equation changed because we divided by a negative number!
For this ﬁrst example, we’ll graph each inequality separately and then combine the results.
Here’s the graph of the ﬁrst inequality:


The line is solid because the equals sign is included in the inequality. Since the inequality is less than or
equal to, we shade below the line.

And here’s the graph of the second inequality:


The line is solid again because the equals sign is included in the inequality. We now shade above the line
because y is greater than or equal to.


When we combine the graphs, we see that the blue and red shaded regions overlap. The area where they
overlap is the area where both inequalities are true. Thus that area (shown below in purple) is the solution
of the system.


The kind of solution displayed in this example is called unbounded, because it continues forever in at
least one direction (in this case, forever upward and to the left).

**Example 2**

There are also situations where a system of inequalities has no solution. For example, let’s solve this
system.


                                                y ≤ 2x − 4
                                                y > 2x + 6


**Solution:**

We start by graphing the ﬁrst line. The line will be solid because the equals sign is included in the
inequality. We must shade downwards because y is less than.

Next we graph the second line on the same coordinate axis. This line will be dashed because the equals
sign is not included in the inequality. We must shade upward because y is greater than.


It doesn’t look like the two shaded regions overlap at all. The two lines have the same slope, so we know
they are parallel; that means that the regions indeed won’t ever overlap since the lines won’t ever cross.
So this system of inequalities has no solution.
But a system of inequalities can sometimes have a solution even if the lines are parallel. For example, what
happens if we swap the directions of the inequality signs in the system we just graphed?
To graph the system
y ≥ 2x − 4
y < 2x + 6,
we draw the same lines we drew for the previous system, but we shade upward for the ﬁrst inequality and
downward for the second inequality. Here is the result:


You can see that this time the shaded regions overlap. The area between the two lines is the solution to
the system.


Graph a System of More Than Two Linear Inequalities
When we solve a system of just two linear inequalities, the solution is always an unbounded region—one
that continues inﬁnitely in at least one direction. But if we put together a system of more than two
inequalities, sometimes we can get a solution that is bounded—a ﬁnite region with three or more sides.
Let’s look at a simple example.

**Example 3**

Find the solution to the following system of inequalities.


                                                  3x − y < 4
                                                 4y + 9x < 8
                                                       x≥0
                                                       y≥0


**Solution:**

Let’s start by writing our inequalities in slope-intercept form.


                                                y > 3x − 4
                                                y<− x+2
                                                x≥0
                                                y≥0


Now we can graph each line and shade appropriately. First we graph y > 3x − 4 :

Next we graph y < − 94 x + 2 :


Finally we graph x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0, and we’re left with the region below; this is where all four inequalities
overlap.


The solution is bounded because there are lines on all sides of the solution region. In other words, the
solution region is a bounded geometric ﬁgure, in this case a triangle.
Notice, too, that only three of the lines we graphed actually form the boundaries of the region. Sometimes
when we graph multiple inequalities, it turns out that some of them don’t aﬀect the overall solution; in
this case, the solution would be the same even if we’d left out the inequality y > 3x − 4. That’s because
the solution region of the system formed by the other three inequalities is completely contained within
the solution region of that fourth inequality; in other words, any solution to the other three inequalities is
automatically a solution to that one too, so adding that inequality doesn’t narrow down the solution set
at all.
But that wasn’t obvious until we actually drew the graph!


Solve Real-World Problems Using Systems of Linear Inequalities
A lot of interesting real-world problems can be solved with systems of linear inequalities.
For example, you go to your favorite restaurant and you want to be served by your best friend who happens
to work there. However, your friend only waits tables in a certain region of the restaurant. The restaurant
is also known for its great views, so you want to sit in a certain area of the restaurant that oﬀers a good
view. Solving a system of linear inequalities will allow you to ﬁnd the area in the restaurant where you
can sit to get the best view and be served by your friend.
Often, systems of linear inequalities deal with problems where you are trying to ﬁnd the best possible
situation given a set of constraints. Most of these application problems fall in a category called linear
programming problems.
Linear programming is the process of taking various linear inequalities relating to some situation, and
ﬁnding the best possible value under those conditions. A typical example would be taking the limitations
of materials and labor at a factory, then determining the best production levels for maximal proﬁts under
those conditions. These kinds of problems are used every day in the organization and allocation of resources.
These real-life systems can have dozens or hundreds of variables, or more. In this section, we’ll only work
with the simple two-variable linear case.
The general process is to:

- Graph the inequalities (called constraints) to form a bounded area on the coordinate plane (called

    the feasibility region).
- Figure out the coordinates of the corners (or vertices) of this feasibility region by solving the system
    of equations that applies to each of the intersection points.
- Test these corner points in the formula (called the optimization equation) for which you’re trying
    to ﬁnd the maximum or minimum value.


**Example 4**

If z = 2x + 5y, ﬁnd the maximum and minimum values of z given these constraints:

                                                 2x − y ≤ 12
                                               4x + 3y ≥ 0
                                                  x−y≤6


**Solution:**

First, we need to ﬁnd the solution to this system of linear inequalities by graphing and shading appropri-
ately. To graph the inequalities, we rewrite them in slope-intercept form:

                                                y ≥ 2x − 12
                                                y≥− x
                                                y≥ x−6

These three linear inequalities are called the constraints, and here is their graph:


The shaded region in the graph is called the feasibility region. All possible solutions to the system occur
in that region; now we must try to ﬁnd the maximum and minimum values of the variable z within that
region. In other words, which values of x and y within the feasibility region will give us the greatest and
smallest overall values for the expression 2x + 5y?
Fortunately, we don’t have to test every point in the region to ﬁnd that out. It just so happens that the
minimum or maximum value of the optimization equation in a linear system like this will always be found
at one of the vertices (the corners) of the feasibility region; we just have to ﬁgure out which vertices. So

for each vertex—each point where two of the lines on the graph cross—we need to solve the system of just
those two equations, and then ﬁnd the value of z at that point.
The ﬁrst system consists of the equations y = 2x − 12 and y = − 43 x. We can solve this system by
substitution:
                         − x = 2x − 12 ⇒ −4x = 6x − 36 ⇒ −10x = −36 ⇒ x = 3.6
                            y = 2x − 12 ⇒ y = 2(3.6) − 12 ⇒ y = −4.8
The lines intersect at the point (3.6, -4.8).
The second system consists of the equations y = 2x−12 and y = x−6. Solving this system by substitution:

                                      x − 6 = 2x − 12 ⇒ 6 = x ⇒ x = 6
                                           y= x−6⇒y=6−6⇒y=6
The lines intersect at the point (6, 6).
The third system consists of the equations y = − 34 x and y = x − 6. Solving this system by substitution:
                             x − 6 = − x ⇒ 3x − 18 = −4x ⇒ 7x = 18 ⇒ x = 2.57
                                 y = x − 6 ⇒ y = 2.57 − 6 ⇒ y = −3.43
The lines intersect at the point (2.57, -3.43).
So now we have three diﬀerent points that might give us the maximum and minimum values for z. To
ﬁnd out which ones actually do give the maximum and minimum values, we can plug the points into the
optimization equation z = 2x + 5y.
When we plug in (3.6, -4.8), we get z = 2(3.6) + 5(−4.8) = −16.8.
When we plug in (6, 0), we get z = 2(6) + 5(0) = 12.
When we plug in (2.57, -3.43), we get z = 2(2.57) + 5(−3.43) = −12.01.
So we can see that the point (6, 0) gives us the maximum possible value for z and the point
(3.6, –4.8) gives us the minimum value.
In the previous example, we learned how to apply the method of linear programming in the abstract. In
the next example, we’ll look at a real-life application.

**Example 5**

You have $10,000 to invest, and three diﬀerent funds to choose from. The municipal bond fund has a 5%
return, the local bank’s CDs have a 7% return, and a high-risk account has an expected 10% return. To
minimize risk, you decide not to invest any more than $1,000 in the high-risk account. For tax reasons,
you need to invest at least three times as much in the municipal bonds as in the bank CDs. What’s the best
way to distribute your money given these constraints?

**Solution:**

Let’s deﬁne our variables:
x is the amount of money invested in the municipal bond at 5% return
y is the amount of money invested in the bank’s CD at 7% return
10000 − x − y is the amount of money invested in the high-risk account at 10% return
z is the total interest returned from all the investments, so z = .05x + .07y + .1(10000 − x − y) or z =
1000 − 0.05x − 0.03y. This is the amount that we are trying to maximize. Our goal is to ﬁnd the values of
x and y that maximizes the value of z.

Now, let’s write inequalities for the constraints:
You decide not to invest more than $1000 in the high-risk account—that means:

                                             10000 − x − y ≤ 1000

You need to invest at least three times as much in the municipal bonds as in the bank CDs—that means:

                                                     3y ≤ x

Also, you can’t invest less than zero dollars in each account, so:

                                                              x≥0
                                                              y≥0
                                              10000 − x − y ≥ 0

To summarize, we must maximize the expression z = 1000 − .05x − .03y using the constraints:

            10000 − x − y ≤ 1000                                                   y ≥ 9000 − x
                                                                                       x
            3y ≤ x                                                                 y≤
            x≥0                              Or in slope-intercept form:           x≥0
            y≥0                                                                    y≥0
            10000 − x − y ≥ 0                                                      y ≤ 10000 − x

Step 1: Find the solution region to the set of inequalities by graphing each line and shading appropriately.
The following ﬁgure shows the overlapping region:


The purple region is the feasibility region where all the possible solutions can occur.
Step 2: Next we need to ﬁnd the corner points of the feasibility region. Notice that there are four corners.
To ﬁnd their coordinates, we must pair up the relevant equations and solve each resulting system.
System 1:
y = 3x
y = 10000 − x

Substitute the ﬁrst equation into the second equation:
                        x
                          = 10000 − x ⇒ x = 30000 − 3x ⇒ 4x = 30000 ⇒ x = 7500
                            x        7500
                        y= ⇒y=            ⇒ y = 2500
                            3          3

The intersection point is (7500, 2500).
System 2:
y = 3x
y = 9000 − x
Substitute the ﬁrst equation into the second equation:
                         x
                           = 9000 − x ⇒ x = 27000 − 3x ⇒ 4x = 27000 ⇒ x = 6750
                             x        6750
                         y= ⇒y=            ⇒ y = 2250
                             3         3

The intersection point is (6750, 2250).
System 3:
y=0
y = 10000 − x.
The intersection point is (10000, 0).
System 4:
y=0
y = 9000 − x.
The intersection point is (9000, 0).
Step 3: In order to ﬁnd the maximum value for z, we need to plug all the intersection points into the
equation for z and ﬁnd which one yields the largest number.
(7500, 2500): z = 1000 − 0.05(7500) − 0.03(2500) = 550
(6750, 2250): z = 1000 − 0.05(6750) − 0.03(2250) = 595
(10000, 0): z = 1000 − 0.05(10000) − 0.03(0) = 500
(9000, 0): z = 1000 − 0.05(9000) − 0.03(0) = 550
The maximum return on the investment of $595 occurs at the point (6750, 2250). This means that:
$6,750 is invested in the municipal bonds.
$2,250 is invested in the bank CDs.
$1,000 is invested in the high-risk account.
Graphing calculators can be very useful for problems that involve this many inequalities. The video at
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__wAxkYmhvY shows a real-world linear programming problem worked
through in detail on a graphing calculator, although the methods used there can also be used for pencil-and
paper solving.

     a wage of ﬁve candy canes per hour worked, but can only make four trucks an hour. Senior elves can
     make six trucks an hour and are paid eight candy canes per hour. There’s only room for nine elves
     in the truck shop, and due to a candy-makers’ strike, Santa Claus can only pay out 480 candy canes

 14. In Adrian’s Furniture Shop, Adrian assembles both bookcases and TV cabinets. Each type of furniture
     takes her about the same time to assemble. She ﬁgures she has time to make at most 18 pieces of
     furniture by this Saturday. The materials for each bookcase cost her $20 and the materials for each
     TV stand costs her $45. She has $600 to spend on materials. Adrian makes a proﬁt of $60 on each

# Chapter 8: Exponential Functions


## 8.1 Exponent Properties Involving Products


### Learning Objectives

- Use the product of a power property.
- Use the power of a product property.
- Simplify expressions involving product properties of exponents.


Introduction
Back in chapter 1, we brieﬂy covered expressions involving exponents, like 35 or x3 . In these expressions,
the number on the bottom is called the base and the number on top is the power or exponent. The
whole expression is equal to the base multiplied by itself a number of times equal to the exponent; in other
words, the exponent tells us how many copies of the base number to multiply together.

**Example 1**

Write in exponential form.
a) 2 · 2
b) (−3)(−3)(−3)
c) y · y · y · y · y
d) (3a)(3a)(3a)(3a)

**Solution:**

a) 2 · 2 = 22 because we have 2 factors of 2
b) (−3)(−3)(−3) = (−3)3 because we have 3 factors of (-3)
c) y · y · y · y · y = y5 because we have 5 factors of y
d) (3a)(3a)(3a)(3a) = (3a)4 because we have 4 factors of 3a
When the base is a variable, it’s convenient to leave the expression in exponential form; if we didn’t write
x7 , we’d have to write x · x · x · x · x · x · x instead. But when the base is a number, we can simplify the
expression further than that; for example, 27 equals 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2, but we can multiply all those 2’s to
get 128.

Let’s simplify the expressions from Example 1.

**Example 2**

Simplify.
a) 22
b) (−3)3
c) y5
d) (3a)4

**Solution:**

a) 22 = 2 · 2 = 4
b) (−3)3 = (−3)(−3)(−3) = −27
c) y5 is already simpliﬁed
d) (3a)4 = (3a)(3a)(3a)(3a) = 3 · 3 · 3 · 3 · a · a · a · a = 81a4
Be careful when taking powers of negative numbers. Remember these rules:
(negative number) · (positive number) = negative number
(negative number) · (negative number) = positive number
So even powers of negative numbers are always positive. Since there are an even number of factors,
we pair up the negative numbers and all the negatives cancel out.

                  (−2)6 = (−2)(−2)(−2)(−2)(−2)(−2) = (−2)(−2) · (−2)(−2) · (−2)(−2) = +64
                                                     | {z } | {z } | {z }
                                                                       +4                +4       +4


And odd powers of negative numbers are always negative. Since there are an odd number of factors,
we can still pair up negative numbers to get positive numbers, but there will always be one negative factor
left over, so the answer is negative:

                      (−2)5 = (−2)(−2)(−2)(−2)(−2) = (−2)(−2) · (−2)(−2) · (−2) = −32
                                                     | {z } | {z } |{z}
                                                                      +4             +4         −2


Use the Product of Powers Property
So what happens when we multiply one power of x by another? Let’s see what happens when we multiply
x to the power of 5 by x cubed. To illustrate better, we’ll use the full factored form for each:

                                (x · x · x · x · x) · (x · x · x) = (x · x · x · x · x · x · x · x)
                                |      {z        } | {z } |                      {z              }
                                        x5               x3                         x8


So x5 × x3 = x8 . You may already see the pattern to multiplying powers, but let’s conﬁrm it with another
example. We’ll multiply x squared by x to the power of 4:

                                       (x · x) · (x · x · x · x) = (x · x · x · x · x · x)
                                       |{z} | {z } |                        {z          }
                                          x2           x4                      x6


So x2 × x4 = x6 . Look carefully at the powers and how many factors there are in each calculation. 5 x’s
times 3 x’s equals (5 + 3) = 8 x’s. 2 x’s times 4 x’s equals (2 + 4) = 6 x’s.

You should see that when we take the product of two powers of x, the number of x’s in the answer is the
total number of x’s in all the terms you are multiplying. In other words, the exponent in the answer is the
sum of the exponents in the product.
Product Rule for Exponents: xn · xm = x(n+m)
There are some easy mistakes you can make with this rule, however. Let’s see how to avoid them.

**Example 3**

Multiply 22 · 23 .

**Solution:**

22 · 23 = 25 = 32
Note that when you use the product rule you don’t multiply the bases. In other words, you must avoid
the common error of writing 22 · 23 = 45 . You can see this is true if you multiply out each expression: 4
times 8 is deﬁnitely 32, not 1024.

**Example 4**

Multiply 22 · 33 .

**Solution:**

22 · 33 = 4 · 27 = 108
In this case, we can’t actually use the product rule at all, because it only applies to terms that have the
same base. In a case like this, where the bases are diﬀerent, we just have to multiply out the numbers by
hand—the answer is not 25 or 35 or 65 or anything simple like that.


Use the Power of a Product Property
What happens when we raise a whole expression to a power? Let’s take x to the power of 4 and cube
it. Again we’ll use the full factored form for each expression:

                                                      (x4 )3 = x4 × x4 × x4           3 f actors o f {x to the power 4}
           (x · x · x · x) · (x · x · x · x) · (x · x · x · x) = x · x · x · x · x · x · x · x · x · x · x · x = x12

So (x4 )3 = x12 . You can see that when we raise a power of x to a new power, the powers multiply.
Power Rule for Exponents: (xn )m = x(n·m)
If we have a product of more than one term inside the parentheses, then we have to distribute the exponent
over all the factors, like distributing multiplication over addition. For example:

                                                   (x2 y)4 = (x2 )4 · (y)4 = x8 y4 .

Or, writing it out the long way:

                      (x2 y)4 = (x2 y)(x2 y)(x2 y)(x2 y) = (x · x · y)(x · x · y)(x · x · y)(x · x · y)
                                                              = x · x · x · x · x · x · x · x · y · y · y · y = x8 y4

Note that this does NOT work if you have a sum or diﬀerence inside the parentheses! For example,
(x + y)2 , x2 + y2 . This is an easy mistake to make, but you can avoid it if you remember what an exponent
means: if you multiply out (x + y)2 it becomes (x + y)(x + y), and that’s not the same as x2 + y2 . We’ll
learn how we can simplify this expression in a later chapter.

The following video from YourTeacher.com may make it clearer how the power rule works for a variety of
exponential expressions:

**Example 5**

Simplify the following expressions.
a) 35 · 37
b) 26 · 2
c) (42 )3

**Solution:**

When we’re just working with numbers instead of variables, we can use the product rule and the power
rule, or we can just do the multiplication and then simplify.
a) We can use the product rule ﬁrst and then evaluate the result: 35 · 37 = 312 = 531441.
OR we can evaluate each part separately and then multiply them: 35 · 37 = 243 · 2187 = 531441.
b) We can use the product rule ﬁrst and then evaluate the result: 26 · 2 = 27 = 128.
OR we can evaluate each part separately and then multiply them: 26 · 2 = 64 · 2 = 128.
c) We can use the power rule ﬁrst and then evaluate the result: (42 )3 = 46 = 4096.
OR we can evaluate the expression inside the parentheses ﬁrst, and then apply the exponent outside the
parentheses: (42 )3 = (16)3 = 4096.

**Example 6**

Simplify the following expressions.
a) x2 · x7
b) (y3 )5

**Solution:**

When we’re just working with variables, all we can do is simplify as much as possible using the product
and power rules.
a) x2 · x7 = x2+7 = x9
b) (y3 )5 = y3×5 = y15

**Example 7**

Simplify the following expressions.
a) (3x2 y3 ) · (4xy2 )
b) (4xyz) · (x2 y3 ) · (2yz4 )
c) (2a3 b3 )2

**Solution:**

When we have a mix of numbers and variables, we apply the rules to each number and variable separately.
a) First we group like terms together: (3x2 y3 ) · (4xy2 ) = (3 · 4) · (x2 · x) · (y3 · y2 )
Then we multiply the numbers or apply the product rule on each grouping: = 12x3 y5
b) Group like terms together: (4xyz) · (x2 y3 ) · (2yz4 ) = (4 · 2) · (x · x2 ) · (y · y3 · y) · (z · z4 )
Multiply the numbers or apply the product rule on each grouping: = 8x3 y5 z5

c) Apply the power rule for each separate term in the parentheses: (2a3 b3 )2 = 22 · (a3 )2 · (b3 )2
Multiply the numbers or apply the power rule for each term = 4a6 b6

**Example 8**

Simplify the following expressions.
a) (x2 )2 · x3
b) (2x2 y) · (3xy2 )3
c) (4a2 b3 )2 · (2ab4 )3

**Solution:**

In problems where we need to apply the product and power rules together, we must keep in mind the order
of operations. Exponent operations take precedence over multiplication.
a) We apply the power rule ﬁrst: (x2 )2 · x3 = x4 · x3
Then apply the product rule to combine the two terms: x4 · x3 = x7
b) Apply the power rule ﬁrst: (2x2 y) · (3xy2 )3 = (2x2 y) · (27x3 y6 )
Then apply the product rule to combine the two terms: (2x2 y) · (27x3 y6 ) = 54x5 y7
c) Apply the power rule on each of the terms separately: (4a2 b3 )2 · (2ab4 )3 = (16a4 b6 ) · (8a3 b12 )
Then apply the product rule to combine the two terms: (16a4 b6 ) · (8a3 b12 ) = 128a7 b18

## 8.2 Exponent Properties Involving Quotients


### Learning Objectives

- Use the quotient of powers property.
- Use the power of a quotient property.
- Simplify expressions involving quotient properties of exponents.


Use the Quotient of Powers Property
The rules for simplifying quotients of exponents are a lot like the rules for simplifying products. Let’s look
at what happens when we divide x7 by x4 :
                                        x7    x·x·x·x·x·x·x          x·x·x
                                            =                  =       = x3
                                                 x · x · x · x
                                        x 4                            1

You can see that when we divide two powers of x, the number of x’s in the solution is the number of x’s in
the top of the fraction minus the number of x’s in the bottom. In other words, when dividing expressions
with the same base, we keep the same base and simply subtract the exponent in the denominator from the
exponent in the numerator.
                                           n
Quotient Rule for Exponents: xxm = x(n−m)
When we have expressions with more than one base, we apply the quotient rule separately for each base:
             x 5 y3   x · x · x · x · x y · y · y   x·x y                       x5 y3
                    =               ·            =    · = x2 y   OR                  = x5−3 · y3−2 = x2 y
             x y  2       x · x · x     y · y     1  1                       x3 y2


**Example 1**

Simplify each of the following expressions using the quotient rule.
a) xx5
b) aa
      5 4
c) aa3 bb2

**Solution:**

a) xx5 = x10−5 = x5

b) aa = a6−1 = a5
    5 4
c) aa3 bb2 = a5−3 · b4−2 = a2 b2
Now let’s see what happens if the exponent in the denominator is bigger than the exponent in the numerator.
For example, what happens when we apply the quotient rule to xx7 ?
The quotient rule tells us to subtract the exponents. 4 minus 7 is -3, so our answer is x−3 . A negative
exponent! What does that mean?
Well, let’s look at what we get when we do the division longhand by writing each term in factored form:

                                       x4
                                           =         x · x · x · x     =
                                                                               1     1
                                                                                   = 3
                                             x · x · x · x · x · x · x   x·x·x
                                       x 7                                          x

Even when the exponent in the denominator is bigger than the exponent in the numerator, we can still
subtract the powers. The x’s that are left over after the others have been canceled out just end up in the
                                                  7                     3                 4
denominator instead of the numerator. Just as xx4 would be equal to x1 (or simply x3 ), xx7 is equal to x13 .
And you can also see that x13 is equal to x−3 . We’ll learn more about negative exponents shortly.

**Example 2**

Simplify the following expressions, leaving all exponents positive.
a) xx6
     2 6
b) aa5bb

**Solution:**

a) Subtract the exponent in the numerator from the exponent in the denominator and leave the x’s in the
               2    1
denominator: xx6 = x6−2 = x14
                                                        2 6            6−1     5
b) Apply the rule to each variable separately: aa5bb = a5−2 · b 1 = ba3


The Power of a Quotient Property
When we raise a whole quotient to a power, another special rule applies. Here is an example:
                ( 3 )4 ( 3 ) ( 3 ) ( 3 ) ( 3 )
                 x      x     x     x     x      (x · x · x) · (x · x · x) · (x · x · x) · (x · x · x)   x12
                      =     ·     ·     ·      =                                                       =
                 y2     y2    y2    y2    y2             (y · y) · (y · y) · (y · y) · (y · y)           y8

Notice that the exponent outside the parentheses is multiplied by the exponent in the numerator and the
exponent in the denominator, separately. This is called the power of a quotient rule:
                              ( n )p   n·p
Power Rule for Quotients: yxm = yxm·p
Let’s apply these new rules to a few examples.

**Example 3**

Simplify the following expressions.
a) 442
b) 557
   ( 4 )2
c) 352

**Solution:**


Since there are just numbers and no variables, we can evaluate the expressions and get rid of the exponents
completely.
a) We can use the quotient rule ﬁrst and then evaluate the result: 442 = 45−2 = 43 = 64
OR we can evaluate each part separately and then divide: 442 = 1024
                                                                16 = 64
b) Use the quotient rule ﬁrst and hen evaluate the result: 557 = 514 = 625

OR evaluate each part separately and then reduce: 557 = 78125
                                                         125     1
                                                              = 625
Notice that it makes more sense to apply the quotient rule ﬁrst for examples (a) and (b). Applying the
exponent rules to simplify the expression before plugging in actual numbers means that we end up with
smaller, easier numbers to work with.
                                                                      ( 4 )2   8
c) Use the power rule for quotients ﬁrst and then evaluate the result: 352 = 354 = 6561
                                                                       ( 4 )2 ( )2
OR evaluate inside the parentheses ﬁrst and then apply the exponent: 352 = 81    25  = 6561

**Example 4**

Simplify the following expressions:
a) xx5
   ( 4 )5
b) xx

**Solution:**

a) Use the quotient rule: xx5 = x12−5 = x7
                                                                  ( 4 )5       20
                                                                   x
b) Use the power rule for quotients and then the quotient rule:     x       = xx5 = x15
                                                                                          ( 4 )5
                                                                                           x
OR use the quotient rule inside the parentheses ﬁrst, then apply the power rule:            x      = (x3 )5 = x15

**Example 5**

Simplify the following expressions.
      2 3
a) 6x  y
    2xy2
   ( 3 3 )2
b) 2a    b
     8a7 b

**Solution:**

When we have a mix of numbers and variables, we apply the rules to each number or each variable
separately.
                                  2 3        2   3
a) Group like terms together: 6x y
                              2xy2
                                   = 62 · xx · yy2
Then reduce the numbers and apply the quotient rule on each fraction to get 3xy.
                                                         ( 3 3 )2 ( 2 )2
b) Apply the quotient rule inside the parentheses ﬁrst: 2a   b
                                                          8a7 b
                                                                   b
                                                                 = 4a4

                                          ( 2 )2
                                           b        b4
Then apply the power rule for quotients: 4a  4   = 16a 8


**Example 6**

Simplify the following expressions.
a) (x2 )2 · xx4
   ( 2 )3 2
b) 16a
     4b5
              · ab16

**Solution:**


In problems where we need to apply several rules together, we must keep the order of operations in mind.
a) We apply the power rule ﬁrst on the ﬁrst term:

                                                             x6     4 x
                                              (x2 )2 ·          = x  ·
                                                             x4        x4

Then apply the quotient rule to simplify the fraction:

                                                            x6
                                                   x4 ·        = x4 · x2
                                                            x4

And ﬁnally simplify with the product rule:

                                                       x4 · x2 = x6

     (          )
         16a2 3 b2
b)        4b5
               · a16
Simplify inside the parentheses by reducing the numbers:
                                                       (         )3
                                                           4a2            b2
                                                                      ·
                                                           b5             a16

Then apply the power rule to the ﬁrst fraction:
                                        (         )3
                                            4a2            b2    64a6 b2
                                                       ·        = 15 · 16
                                            b5             a 16   b   a

Group like terms together:

                                        64a6 b2         a6 b2
                                             ·   = 64 ·    ·
                                         b15 a16        a16 b15

And apply the quotient rule to each fraction:

                                                   a6 b2      64

### Learning Objectives

- Simplify expressions with zero exponents.
- Simplify expression with fractional exponents.
- Evaluate exponential expressions.


Introduction
The product and quotient rules for exponents lead to many interesting concepts. For example, so far we’ve
mostly just considered positive, whole numbers as exponents, but you might be wondering what happens
when the exponent isn’t a positive whole number. What does it mean to raise something to the power of
zero, or -1, or 21 ? In this lesson, we’ll ﬁnd out.


Simplify Expressions With Negative Exponents
                                                   ( n        )
When we learned the quotient rule for exponents xxm = x(n−m) , we saw that it applies even when the expo-
nent in the denominator is bigger than the one in the numerator. Canceling out the factors in the numerator
and denominator leaves the leftover factors in the denominator, and subtracting the exponents leaves a

negative number. So negative exponents simply represent fractions with exponents in the denominator.
This can be summarized in a rule:
Negative Power Rule for Exponents: x−n = x1n , where x , 0
Negative exponents can be applied to products and quotients also. Here’s an example of a negative exponent
being applied to a product:

               (x3 y)−2 = x−6 y−2        using the power rule
                          1 1      1
               x−6 y−2 = 6 · 2 = 6 2     using the negative power rule separately on each variable
                         x y      x y

And here’s one applied to a quotient:
               ( a )−3       a−3
                         =               using the power rule for quotients
                b            b−3
               a−3     a−3 1      1 b3
                    =         · =   ·    using the negative power rule on each variable separately
               b−3       1 b−3    a3 1
               1 b3          b3
                  ·     =                simplifying the division of fractions
               a3 1          a3
                     (   ) 3
               b3      b
                  =                      using the power rule for quotients in reverse.
               a3      a

That last step wasn’t really necessary, but putting the answer in that form shows us something useful:
( )−3            ( )3
 a
 b    is equal to ba . This is an example of a rule we can apply more generally:
                                         ( )−n ( y )n
Negative Power Rule for Fractions: yx          = x , where x , 0, y , 0
This rule can be useful when you want to write out an expression without using fractions.

**Example 1**

Write the following expressions without fractions.
a) 1x
b) x22
c) yx3
d) xy

**Solution:**

a) 1x = x−1
b) x22 = 2x−2
c) yx3 = x2 y−3


d) xy = 3x−1 y−1

**Example 2**

Simplify the following expressions and write them without fractions.
         2 3
a) 4a  b
    2a5 b
   ( )3 2
b) 3yx2 · x4y

**Solution:**


a) Reduce the numbers and apply the quotient rule to each variable separately:
                                        4a2 b3
                                               = 2 · a2−5 · b3−1 = 2a−3 b2
                                        2a5 b

b) Apply the power rule for quotients ﬁrst:
                                         ( )3 2
                                          2x    x y   8x3 x2 y
                                              ·     =     ·
                                           y2    4     y6   4

Then simplify the numbers, and use the product rule on the x’s and the quotient rule on the y’s:
                                      8x3 x2 y
                                          ·    = 2 · x3+2 · y1−6 = 2x5 y−5
                                       y6   4

You can also use the negative power rule the other way around if you want to write an expression without
negative exponents.

**Example 3**

Write the following expressions without negative exponents.
a) 3x−3
b) a2 b−3 c−1
c) 4x−1 y3
      −2
d) 2x
    y−3

**Solution:**

a) 3x−3 = x33
b) a2 b−3 c−1 = ba3 c


c) 4x−1 y3 = 4yx
      −2        3
d) 2x
    y−3
        = 2y
           x2

**Example 4**

Simplify the following expressions and write the answers without negative powers.
  ( −2 )2
a) abb3
     −3 2
b) xx2 y−2
        y


**Solution:**

                                                        (      )
                                                            ab−2 2
a) Apply the quotient rule inside the parentheses:           b3
                                                                   = (ab−5 )2

Then apply the power rule: (ab−5 )2 = a2 b−10 = ba10


                                                                   −3 2                            4
b) Apply the quotient rule to each variable separately: xx2 y−2
                                                             y
                                                                = x−3−2 y2−(−2) = x−5 y4 = yx5


Simplify Expressions with Exponents of Zero
                                                        ( n                )
                                                            x      (n−m)
Let’s look again at the quotient rule for exponents         xm = x             and consider what happens when n = m.
For example, what happens when we divide x4 by x4 ? Applying the quotient rule tells us that xx4 = x(4−4) =
x0 —so what does that zero mean?

Well, we ﬁrst discovered the quotient rule by considering how the factors of x cancel in such a fraction.
Let’s do that again with our example of x4 divided by x4 :
                                             x4     x·x·x·x
                                                 =     =1
                                                   x · x · x · x
                                             x 4


So x0 = 1! You can see that this works for any value of the exponent, not just 4:
                                               xn
                                                  = x(n−n) = x0
                                               xn
Since there is the same number of x’s in the numerator as in the denominator, they cancel each other out
and we get x0 = 1. This rule applies for all expressions:
Zero Rule for Exponents: x0 = 1, where x , 0

Simplify Expressions With Fractional Exponents
So far we’ve only looked at expressions where the exponents are positive and negative integers. The rules
we’ve learned work exactly the same if the powers are fractions or irrational numbers—but what does a
fractional exponent even mean? Let’s see if we can ﬁgure that out by using the rules we already know.
Suppose we have an expression like 9 2 —how can we relate this expression to one that we already know
how to work with? For example, how could we turn it into an expression that doesn’t have any fractional
exponents?
Well, the power rule tells us that if we raise an exponential expression to a power, we can multiply the
                                                                 ( 1 )2     1
exponents. For example, if we raise 9 2 to the power of 2, we get 9 2 = 92· 2 = 91 = 9.
          1                             1
So if 9 2 squared equals 9, what does 9 2 itself equal? Well, 3 is the number whose square is 9 (that is, it’s
the square root of 9), so 9 2 must equal 3. And that’s true for all numbers and variables: a number raised
                                                                                 √      1
to the power of 12 is just the square root of the number. We can write that as x = x 2 , and then we can
                         ( √ )2             ( 1 )2
see that’s true because     x = x just as x 2 = x.
                                                                                                     1    √
Similarly, a number to the power of 13 is just the cube root of the number, and so on. In general, x n = n x.
And when we raise a number to a power and then take the root of it, we still get a fractional exponent;
               √
                      ( )1      4
for example, x4 = x4 3 = x 3 . In general, the rule is as follows:
                                       √
                                       m         n
                                                      ( √ )n     n
Rule for Fractional Exponents: an = a m and m a = a m
We’ll examine roots and radicals in detail in a later chapter. In this section, we’ll focus on how exponent
rules apply to fractional exponents.

## 8.4 Scientiﬁc Notation


### Learning Objectives

- Write numbers in scientiﬁc notation.
- Evaluate expressions in scientiﬁc notation.
- Evaluate expressions in scientiﬁc notation using a graphing calculator.


Introduction
Consider the number six hundred and forty three thousand, two hundred and ninety seven. We write it as
643,297 and each digit’s position has a “value” assigned to it. You may have seen a table like this before:

                 hundred-thousands     ten-thousands      thousands   hundreds tens   units
                        6                    4                3          2       9      7

We’ve seen that when we write an exponent above a number, it means that we have to multiply a certain
number of copies of that number together. We’ve also seen that a zero exponent always gives us 1, and
negative exponents give us fractional answers.
Look carefully at the table above. Do you notice that all the column headings are powers of ten? Here
they are listed:

                                                  100, 000 = 105
                                                   10, 000 = 104
                                                    1, 000 = 103
                                                      100 = 102
                                                       10 = 101

Even the “units” column is really just a power of ten. Unit means 1, and 1 is 100 .
If we divide 643,297 by 100,000 we get 6.43297; if we multiply 6.43297 by 100,000 we get 643, 297. But we
have just seen that 100,000 is the same as 105 , so if we multiply 6.43297 by 105 we should also get 643,297.
In other words,

                                          643, 297 = 6.43297 × 105

Writing Numbers in Scientiﬁc Notation
In scientiﬁc notation, numbers are always written in the form a × 10b , where b is an integer and a is
between 1 and 10 (that is, it has exactly 1 nonzero digit before the decimal). This notation is especially
useful for numbers that are either very small or very large.
Here’s a set of examples:

                                           1.07 × 104 = 10, 700
                                           1.07 × 103 = 1, 070
                                           1.07 × 102 = 107
                                           1.07 × 101 = 10.7
                                           1.07 × 100 = 1.07
                                          1.07 × 10−1 = 0.107
                                          1.07 × 10−2 = 0.0107
                                          1.07 × 10−3 = 0.00107
                                          1.07 × 10−4 = 0.000107

Look at the ﬁrst example and notice where the decimal point is in both expressions.


So the exponent on the ten acts to move the decimal point over to the right. An exponent of 4 moves it 4
places and an exponent of 3 would move it 3 places.


This makes sense because each time you multiply by 10, you move the decimal point one place to the right.
1.07 times 10 is 10.7, times 10 again is 107.0, and so on.
Similarly, if you look at the later examples in the table, you can see that a negative exponent on the 10
means the decimal point moves that many places to the left. This is because multiplying by 10−1 is the
same as multiplying by 10   , which is like dividing by 10. So instead of moving the decimal point one place
to the right for every multiple of 10, we move it one place to the left for every multiple of 10 .
That’s how to convert numbers from scientiﬁc notation to standard form. When we’re converting numbers
to scientiﬁc notation, however, we have to apply the whole process backwards. First we move the decimal
point until it’s immediately after the ﬁrst nonzero digit; then we count how many places we moved it. If
we moved it to the left, the exponent on the 10 is positive; if we moved it to the right, it’s negative.
So, for example, to write 0.000032 in scientiﬁc notation, we’d ﬁrst move the decimal ﬁve places to the right
to get 3.2; then, since we moved it right, the exponent on the 10 should be negative ﬁve, so the number in
scientiﬁc notation is 3.2 × 10−5 .

You can double-check whether you’ve got the right direction by comparing the number in scientiﬁc notation
with the number in standard form, and thinking “Does this represent a big number or a small number?”
A positive exponent on the 10 represents a number bigger than 10 and a negative exponent represents a
number smaller than 10, and you can easily tell if the number in standard form is bigger or smaller than
10 just by looking at it.
For more practice, try the online tool at http://hotmath.com/util/hm_flash_movie.html?movie=/learning_
activities/interactivities/sciNotation.swf. Click the arrow buttons to move the decimal point un-
til the number in the middle is written in proper scientiﬁc notation, and see how the exponent changes as
you move the decimal point.

**Example 1**

Write the following numbers in scientiﬁc notation.
a) 63
b) 9,654
c) 653,937,000
d) 0.003
e) 0.000056
f) 0.00005007

**Solution:**

a) 63 = 6.3 × 10 = 6.3 × 101
b) 9, 654 = 9.654 × 1, 000 = 9.654 × 103
c) 653, 937, 000 = 6.53937000 × 100, 000, 000 = 6.53937 × 108
d) 0.003 = 3 × 1000
                    = 3 × 10−3
e) 0.000056 = 5.6 × 100,000
                            = 5.6 × 10−5
f) 0.00005007 = 5.007 × 100,000
                                = 5.007 × 10−5


Evaluating Expressions in Scientiﬁc Notation
When we are faced with products and quotients involving scientiﬁc notation, we need to remember the
rules for exponents that we learned earlier. It’s relatively straightforward to work with scientiﬁc notation
problems if you remember to combine all the powers of 10 together. The following examples illustrate this.

**Example 2**

Evaluate the following expressions and write your answer in scientiﬁc notation.
a) (3.2 × 106 ) · (8.7 × 1011 )
b) (5.2 × 10−4 ) · (3.8 × 10−19 )
c) (1.7 × 106 ) · (2.7 × 10−11 )

**Solution:**

The key to evaluating expressions involving scientiﬁc notation is to group the powers of 10 together and
deal with them separately.
a) (3.2 × 106 )(8.7 × 1011 ) = |  × 8.7
                               3.2{z  } × 10
                                          | {z × 1011
                                                    } = 27.84 × 10 . But 27.84 × 10 isn’t in proper scientiﬁc
                                                                  17               17

                                    27.84   1017

notation, because it has more than one digit before the decimal point. We need to move the decimal point
one more place to the left and add 1 to the exponent, which gives us 2.784 × 1018 .
                                                −4
b) (5.2 × 10−4 )(3.8 × 10−19 ) = 5.2
                                 | {z× 3.8
                                         } × 10
                                             | {z  × 10−19
                                                         } = 19.76 × 10
                                                                        −23 = 1.976 × 10−22

                                     19.76       10−23

c) (1.7 × 106 )(2.7 × 10−11 ) = |  × 2.7
                                1.7{z  } × 10
                                           | ×
                                                 10−11
                                                {z   } = 4.59 × 10
                                                                   −5

                                    4.59        10−5
When we use scientiﬁc notation in the real world, we often round oﬀ our calculations. Since we’re often
dealing with very big or very small numbers, it can be easier to round oﬀ so that we don’t have to keep
track of as many digits—and scientiﬁc notation helps us with that by saving us from writing out all the
extra zeros. For example, if we round oﬀ 4,227, 457,903 to 4,200,000,000, we can then write it in scientiﬁc
notation as simply 4.2 × 109 .
When rounding, we often talk of signiﬁcant ﬁgures or signiﬁcant digits. Signiﬁcant ﬁgures include

- all nonzero digits
- all zeros that come before a nonzero digit and after either a decimal point or another nonzero digit

For example, the number 4000 has one signiﬁcant digit; the zeros don’t count because there’s no nonzero
digit after them. But the number 4000.5 has ﬁve signiﬁcant digits: the 4, the 5, and all the zeros in
between. And the number 0.003 has three signiﬁcant digits: the 3 and the two zeros that come between
the 3 and the decimal point.

**Example 3**

Evaluate the following expressions. Round to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures and write your answer in scientiﬁc
notation.
a) (3.2 × 106 ) ÷ (8.7 × 1011 )
b) (5.2 × 10−4 ) ÷ (3.8 × 10−19 )
c) (1.7 × 106 ) ÷ (2.7 × 10−11 )

**Solution:**

It’s easier if we convert to fractions and THEN separate out the powers of 10.
a)
                                       3.2 × 106
        (3.2 × 106 ) ÷ (8.7 × 1011 ) =                         − separate out the powers o f 10 :
                                      8.7 × 1011
                                      3.2 106
                                    =      ×                   − evaluate each f raction (round to 3 s. f.) :
                                      8.7 1011
                                    = 0.368 × 10(6−11)
                                    = 0.368 × 10−5             − remember how to write scienti f ic notation!
                                    = 3.68 × 10−6

b)
                                        5.2 × 10−4
       (5.2 × 10−4 ) ÷ (3.8 × 10−19 ) =                            − separate the powers o f 10 :
                                       3.8 × 10−19
                                       5.2 10−4
                                     =      ×                      − evaluate each f raction (round to 3 s. f.)
                                       3.8 10−19
                                     = 1.37 × 10((−4)−(−19))
                                     = 1.37 × 1015

c)
                                      1.7 × 106
      (1.7 × 106 ) ÷ (2.7 × 10−11 ) =                         − next we separate the powers o f 10 :
                                     2.7 × 10−11
                                     1.7    106
                                   =     × −11                − evaluate each f raction (round to 3 s. f.)
                                     2.7 10
                                   = 0.630 × 10(6−(−11))
                                   = 0.630 × 1017
                                   = 6.30 × 1016

Note that we have to leave in the ﬁnal zero to indicate that the result has been rounded.


Evaluate Expressions in Scientiﬁc Notation Using a Graphing
Calculator
All scientiﬁc and graphing calculators can use scientiﬁc notation, and it’s very useful to know how.
To insert a number in scientiﬁc notation, use the [EE] button. This is [2nd] [,] on some TI models.
For example, to enter 2.6 × 105 , enter 2.6 [EE] 5. When you hit [ENTER] the calculator displays 2.6E5
if it’s set in Scientiﬁc mode, or 260000 if it’s set in Normal mode.


(To change the mode, press the ‘Mode’ key.)

**Example 4**

Evaluate (2.3 × 106 ) × (4.9 × 10−10 ) using a graphing calculator.

**Solution:**

Enter 2.3 [EE] 6 × 4.9 [EE] - 10 and press [ENTER].


The calculator displays 6.296296296E16 whether it’s in Normal mode or Scientiﬁc mode. That’s because
the number is so big that even in Normal mode it won’t ﬁt on the screen. The answer displayed instead
isn’t the precisely correct answer; it’s rounded oﬀ to 10 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Since it’s a repeating decimal, though, we can write it more eﬀiciently and more precisely as 6.296 × 1016 .

**Example 5**

Evaluate (4.5 × 1014 )3 using a graphing calculator.


**Solution:**

Enter (4.5 [EE] 14)∧ 3 and press [ENTER].


The calculator displays 9.1125E43. The answer is 9.1125 × 1043 .


Solve Real-World Problems Using Scientiﬁc Notation

**Example 6**

The mass of a single lithium atom is approximately one percent of one millionth of one billionth of one
billionth of one kilogram. Express this mass in scientiﬁc notation.

**Solution:**

We know that a percent is 100 , and so our calculation for the mass (in kg) is:
             1         1                1                1
                ×              ×                ×                = 10−2 × 10−6 × 10−9 × 10−9
           100 1, 000, 000 1, 000, 000, 000 1, 000, 000, 000
Next we use the product of powers rule we learned earlier:
                        10−2 × 10−6 × 10−9 × 10−9 = 10((−2)+(−6)+(−9)+(−9)) = 10−26 kg.

The mass of one lithium atom is approximately 1 × 10−26 kg.

**Example 7**

You could ﬁt about 3 million E. coli bacteria on the head of a pin. If the size of the pin head in question
is 1.2 × 10−5 m2 , calculate the area taken up by one E. coli bacterium. Express your answer in scientiﬁc
notation

**Solution:**

Since we need our answer in scientiﬁc notation, it makes sense to convert 3 million to that format ﬁrst:
                                             3, 000, 000 = 3 × 106

Next we need an expression involving our unknown, the area taken up by one bacterium. Call this A.
        3 × 106 · A = 1.2 × 10−5        − since 3 million o f them make up the area o f the pin − head

Isolate A:
         A=            · 1.2 × 10−5        − rearranging the terms gives :
             3 × 106
             1.2 1
         A=       ·      × 10−5            − then using the de f inition o f a negative exponent :

Introduction
Consider the following question:
Which would you prefer, being given one million dollars, or one penny the ﬁrst day, double that penny the
next day, and then double the previous day’s pennies and so on for a month?
At ﬁrst glance it’s easy to say ”Give me the million!” But why don’t we do a few calculations to see how
the other choice stacks up?
You start with a penny the ﬁrst day and keep doubling each day. Doubling means that we keep multiplying
by 2 each day for one month (30 days).
On the ﬁrst day, you get 1 penny, or 20 pennies.
On the second day, you get 2 pennies, or 21 pennies.
On the third day, you get 4 pennies, or 22 pennies. Do you see the pattern yet?
On the fourth day, you get 8 pennies, or 23 pennies. Each day, the exponent is one less than the number
of that day.
So on the thirtieth day, you get 229 pennies, which is 536,870,912 pennies, or $5,368,709.12. That’s a lot
more than a million dollars, even just counting the amount you get on that one day!
This problem is an example of a geometric sequence. In this section, we’ll ﬁnd out what a geometric
sequence is and how to solve problems involving geometric sequences.


Identify a Geometric Sequence
A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number in the sequence is found by
multiplying the previous number by a ﬁxed amount called the common ratio. In other words, the ratio
between any term and the term before it is always the same. In the previous example the common ratio
was 2, as the number of pennies doubled each day.
The common ratio, r, in any geometric sequence can be found by dividing any term by the preceding term.
Here are some examples of geometric sequences and their common ratios.

                       4, 16, 64, 256, . . .       r=4         (divide 16 by 4 to get 4)
                       15, 30, 60, 120, . . .      r=2          (divide 30 by 15 to get 2)
                           11 11 11 11                1        (        11                1)
                       11, , , , , . . .           r=            divide    by 11 to get
                            2 4 8 16                  2                  2                2
                                    1 1                1      (                         1)
                       25, −5, 1, − , , . . .      r=−          divide 1 by -5 to get −
                                    5 25               5                                5

If we know the common ratio r, we can ﬁnd the next term in the sequence just by multiplying the last
term by r. Also, if there are any terms missing in the sequence, we can ﬁnd them by multiplying the term
before each missing term by the common ratio.

**Example 1**

Fill is the missing terms in each geometric sequence.
a) 1, ___, 25, 125, ___
b) 20, ___, 5, ___, 1.25

**Solution:**

a) First we can ﬁnd the common ratio by dividing 125 by 25 to obtain r = 5.
To ﬁnd the ﬁrst missing term, we multiply 1 by the common ratio: 1 · 5 = 5
To ﬁnd the second missing term, we multiply 125 by the common ratio: 125 · 5 = 625
Sequence (a) becomes: 1, 5, 25, 125, 625,...
b) We need to ﬁnd the common ratio ﬁrst, but how do we do that when we have no terms next to each
other that we can divide?
Well, we know that to get from 20 to 5 in the sequence we must multiply 20 by the common ratio twice:
once to get to the second term in the sequence, and again to get to ﬁve. So we can say 20 · r · r = 5, or
20 · r2 = 5.
Dividing both sides by 20, we get r2 = 20 = 14 , or r = 12 (because 21 · 21 = 14 ).
To get the ﬁrst missing term, we multiply 20 by 21 and get 10.
To get the second missing term, we multiply 5 by 12 and get 2.5.
Sequence (b) becomes: 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25,...
You can see that if we keep multiplying by the common ratio, we can ﬁnd any term in the sequence that
we want—the tenth term, the ﬁftieth term, the thousandth term.... However, it would be awfully tedious
to keep multiplying over and over again in order to ﬁnd a term that is a long way from the start. What
could we do instead of just multiplying repeatedly?
Let’s look at a geometric sequence that starts with the number 7 and has common ratio of 2.

        The 1 st term is:                                               7                      or   7 · 20
        We obtain the 2nd term by multiplying by 2 :                    7·2                    or   7 · 21
        We obtain the 3rd term by multiplying by 2 again:               7·2·2                  or   7 · 22
        We obtain the 4th term by multiplying by 2 again:               7·2·2·2                or   7 · 23
        We obtain the 5th term by multiplying by 2 again:               7·2·2·2·2              or   7 · 24
        The nth term would be:                                          7 · 2n−1

The nth term is 7 · 2n−1 because the 7 is multiplied by 2 once for the 2nd term, twice for the third term, and
so on—for each term, one less time than the term’s place in the sequence. In general, we write a geometric
sequence with n terms like this:

                                           a, ar, ar2 , ar3 , . . . , arn−1

The formula for ﬁnding a speciﬁc term in a geometric sequence is:
nth term in a geometric sequence: an = a1 rn−1
(a1 = ﬁrst term, r = common ratio)

**Example 2**

For each of these geometric sequences, ﬁnd the eighth term in the sequence.
a) 1, 2, 4,...
b) 16, -8, 4, -2, 1,...

**Solution:**

a) First we need to ﬁnd the common ratio: r = 21 = 2.
The eighth term is given by the formula a8 = a1 r7 = 1 · 27 = 128
In other words, to get the eighth term we start with the ﬁrst term, which is 1, and then multiply by 2
seven times.
b) The common ratio is r = −8   −1
                           16 = 2
                                                    ( )7       (−1)7
The eighth term in the sequence is a8 = a1 r7 = 16 · −1
                                                      2  = 16 · 27 = 16 · −1
                                                                             = −16
                                                                               128 = − 8

Let’s take another look at the terms in that second sequence. Notice that they alternate positive, neg-
ative, positive, negative all the way down the list. When you see this pattern, you know the common
ratio is negative; multiplying by a negative number each time means that the sign of each term is opposite
the sign of the previous term.


Solve Real-World Problems Involving Geometric Sequences
Let’s solve two application problems involving geometric sequences.

**Example 3**

A courtier presented the Indian king with a beautiful, hand-made chessboard. The king asked what he would
like in return for his gift and the courtier surprised the king by asking for one grain of rice on the ﬁrst
square, two grains on the second, four grains on the third, etc. The king readily agreed and asked for the
rice to be brought. (From Meadows et al. 1972, via Porritt 2005) How many grains of rice does the king
have to put on the last square?

**Solution:**

A chessboard is an 8 × 8 square grid, so it contains a total of 64 squares.
The courtier asked for one grain of rice on the ﬁrst square, 2 grains of rice on the second square, 4 grains
of rice on the third square and so on. We can write this as a geometric sequence:
1, 2, 4,...
The numbers double each time, so the common ratio is r = 2.
The problem asks how many grains of rice the king needs to put on the last square, so we need to ﬁnd the
64th term in the sequence. Let’s use our formula:

an = a1 rn−1 , where an is the nth term, a1 is the ﬁrst term and r is the common ratio.
a64 = 1 · 263 = 9, 223, 372, 036, 854, 775, 808 grains of rice.
The problem we just solved has real applications in business and technology. In technology strategy,
the Second Half of the Chessboard is a phrase, coined by a man named Ray Kurzweil, in reference
to the point where an exponentially growing factor begins to have a signiﬁcant economic impact on an
organization’s overall business strategy.
The total number of grains of rice on the ﬁrst half of the chessboard is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 +
256 + 512 + 1024 . . . + 2, 147, 483, 648, for a total of exactly 4,294,967,295 grains of rice, or about 100,000 kg
of rice (the mass of one grain of rice being roughly 25 mg). This total amount is about 1,000,000         th of total
rice production in India in the year 2005 and is an amount the king could surely have aﬀorded.
The total number of grains of rice on the second half of the chessboard is 232 + 233 + 234 . . . + 263 , for a
total of 18, 446, 744, 069, 414, 584, 320 grains of rice. This is about 460 billion tons, or 6 times the entire
weight of all living matter on Earth. The king didn’t realize what he was agreeing to—perhaps he should
have studied algebra! [Wikipedia; GNU-FDL]

**Example 4**

A super-ball has a 75% rebound ratio—that is, when it bounces repeatedly, each bounce is 75% as high as
the previous bounce. When you drop it from a height of 20 feet:
a) how high does the ball bounce after it strikes the ground for the third time?
b) how high does the ball bounce after it strikes the ground for the seventeenth time?

**Solution:**

We can write a geometric sequence that gives the height of each bounce with the common ratio of r = 34 :


                                                 3       ( 3 )2        ( 3 )3
                                         20, 20 · , 20 ·        , 20 ·        ...
                                                 4         4             4


a) The ball starts at a height of 20 feet; after the ﬁrst bounce it reaches a height of 20 · 43 = 15 f eet.
                                                      ( )2
After the second bounce it reaches a height of 20 · 34 = 11.25 f eet.
                                                    ( )3
After the third bounce it reaches a height of 20 · 43 = 8.44 f eet.
b) Notice that the height after the ﬁrst bounce corresponds to the second term in the sequence, the height
after the second bounce corresponds to the third term in the sequence and so on.
This means that the height after the seventeenth bounce corresponds to the 18th term in the sequence. You
can ﬁnd the height by using the formula for the 18th term:


                                                        ( 3 )17
                                           a18 = 20 ·             = 0.15 f eet.


Here is a graph that represents this information. (The heights at points other than the top of each bounce
are just approximations.)

## 8.6 Exponential Functions


### Learning Objectives

- Graph an exponential function.
- Compare graphs of exponential functions.
- Analyze the properties of exponential functions.


Introduction
A colony of bacteria has a population of three thousand at noon on Monday. During the next week, the
colony’s population doubles every day. What is the population of the bacteria colony just before midnight
on Saturday?
At ﬁrst glance, this seems like a problem you could solve using a geometric sequence. And you could, if
the bacteria population doubled all at once every day; since it doubled every day for ﬁve days, the ﬁnal
population would be 3000 times 25 .
But bacteria don’t reproduce all at once; their population grows slowly over the course of an entire day.
So how do we ﬁgure out the population after ﬁve and a half days?


Exponential Functions
Exponential functions are a lot like geometrical sequences. The main diﬀerence between them is that a
geometric sequence is discrete while an exponential function is continuous.
Discrete means that the sequence has values only at distinct points (the 1st term, 2nd term, etc.)
Continuous means that the function has values for all possible values of x. The integers are included, but
also all the numbers in between.
The problem with the bacteria is an example of a continuous function. Here’s an example of a discrete
function:
An ant walks past several stacks of Lego blocks. There is one block in the ﬁrst stack, 3 blocks in the 2nd
stack and 9 blocks in the 3rd stack. In fact, in each successive stack there are triple the number of blocks
than in the previous stack.
In this example, each stack has a distinct number of blocks and the next stack is made by adding a
certain number of whole pieces all at once. More importantly, however, there are no values of the sequence
between the stacks. You can’t ask how high the stack is between the 2nd and 3rd stack, as no stack exists
at that position!
As a result of this diﬀerence, we use a geometric series to describe quantities that have values at discrete
points, and we use exponential functions to describe quantities that have values that change continuously.

When we graph an exponential function, we draw the graph with a solid curve to show that the function
has values at any time during the day. On the other hand, when we graph a geometric sequence, we draw
discrete points to signify that the sequence only has value at those points but not in between.
Here are graphs for the two examples above:


The formula for an exponential function is similar to the formula for ﬁnding the terms in a geometric
sequence. An exponential function takes the form

                                                   y = A · bx

where A is the starting amount and b is the amount by which the total is multiplied every time. For
example, the bacteria problem above would have the equation y = 3000 · 2 x .


Compare Graphs of Exponential Functions
Let’s graph a few exponential functions and see what happens as we change the constants in the formula.
The basic shape of the exponential function should stay the same—but it may become steeper or shallower
depending on the constants we are using.
First, let’s see what happens when we change the value of A.

**Example 1**

Compare the graphs of y = 2 x and y = 3 · 2 x .

**Solution:**

Let’s make a table of values for both functions.
                                                  Table 8.1:

 3                                    8                              y = 3 · 23 = 3 · 8 = 24


Now let’s use this table to graph the functions.


We can see that the function y = 3 · 2 x is bigger than the function y = 2 x . In both functions, the value of y
doubles every time x increases by one. However, y = 3 · 2 x “starts” with a value of 3, while y = 2 x “starts”
with a value of 1, so it makes sense that y = 3 · 2 x would be bigger as its values of y keep getting doubled.
Similarly, if the starting value of A is smaller, the values of the entire function will be smaller.

**Example 2**

Compare the graphs of y = 2 x and y = 13 · 2 x .

**Solution:**

Let’s make a table of values for both functions.
                                                   Table 8.2:

 x                                     y = 2x                               y = 13 · 2 x
  -3                                   1
                                       8                                    y = 13 · 2−3 = 13 · 213 = 24

 -2                                    1                                              −2
                                                                            y = 3 · 2 = 3 · 22 = 12
                                                                                1            1   1     1
 -1                                    1
                                       2                                    y = 3 · 2−1 = 3 · 21 = 6
                                                                                1            1   1    1

 0                                     1                                    y = 13 · 20 = 13
 1                                     2                                    y = 13 · 21 = 23
 2                                     4                                    y = 13 · 22 = 13 · 4 = 43
 3                                     8                                    y = 13 · 23 = 13 · 8 = 83


Now let’s use this table to graph the functions.

As we expected, the exponential function y = 13 · 2 x is smaller than the exponential function y = 2 x .
So what happens if the starting value of A is negative? Let’s ﬁnd out.

**Example 3**

Graph the exponential function y = −5 · 2 x .

**Solution:**

Let’s make a table of values:
                                                 Table 8.3:

 x                                                      y = −5 · 2 x
  -2                                                    − 54
 -1                                                     − 52
 0                                                      -5
 1                                                      -10
 2                                                      -20
 3                                                      -40


Now let’s graph the function:


This result shouldn’t be unexpected. Since the starting value is negative and keeps doubling over time, it
makes sense that the value of y gets farther from zero, but in a negative direction. The graph is basically

just like the graph of y = 5 · 2 x , only mirror-reversed about the x−axis.
Now, let’s compare exponential functions whose bases (b) are diﬀerent.

**Example 4**

Graph the following exponential functions on the same graph: y = 2 x , y = 3 x , y = 5 x , y = 10 x .

**Solution:**

First we’ll make a table of values for all four functions.
                                                    Table 8.4:

 x                      y = 2x                 y = 3x                  y = 5x                 y = 10 x
                        1                       1                       1                      1
  -2                    4                       9                      25                     100
                        1                       1                      1                       1
 -1                     2                       3                      5                      10
 0                      1                      1                       1                      1
 1                      2                      3                       5                      10
 2                      4                      9                       25                     100
 3                      8                      27                      125                    1000


Now let’s graph the functions.


Notice that for x = 0, all four functions equal 1. They all “start out” at the same point, but the ones with
higher values for b grow faster when x is positive—and also shrink faster when x is negative.
Finally, let’s explore what happens for values of b that are less than 1.

**Example 5**

                                      ( )x
Graph the exponential function y = 5 · 12 .

**Solution:**

Let’s start by making a table of values. (Remember that a fraction to a negative power is equivalent to its
reciprocal to the same positive power.)

                                                    Table 8.5:
                                                                  ( )x
 x                                                         y = 5 · 12
                                                                  ( )−3
  -3                                                       y = 5 · 12   = 5 · 23 = 40
                                                                  ( )−2
 -2                                                        y = 5 · 12   = 5 · 22 = 20

                                          Table 8.5: (continued)
                                                              ( )x
 x                                                     y = 5 · 12
                                                              ( )−1
 -1                                                    y = 5 · 12   = 5 · 21 = 10
                                                              ( )0
 0                                                     y = 5 · 12 = 5 · 1 = 5
                                                              ( )1
 1                                                     y = 5 · 12 = 52
                                                              ( )2
 2                                                     y = 5 · 12 = 54


Now let’s graph the function.


This graph looks very diﬀerent than the graphs from the previous example! What’s going on here?
When we raise a number greater than 1 to the power of x, it gets bigger as x gets bigger. But when we
raise a number smaller than 1 to the power of x, it gets smaller as x gets bigger—as you can see from the
table of values above. This makes sense because multiplying any number by a quantity less than 1 always
makes it smaller.
So, when the base b of an exponential function is between 0 and 1, the graph is like an ordinary exponential
graph, only decreasing instead of increasing. Graphs like this represent exponential decay instead of
exponential growth. Exponential decay functions are used to describe quantities that decrease over a
period of time.
When b can be written as a fraction, we can
                                         ( ) x use the Property of Negative Exponents to write the function
in a diﬀerent form. For instance, y = 5 · 21 is equivalent to 5 · 2−x . These two forms are both commonly
used, so it’s important to know that they are equivalent.

**Example 6**

Graph the exponential function y = 8 · 3−x .

**Solution:**

Here is our table of values and the graph of the function.


                                                Table 8.6:

 x                                                      y = 8 · 3−x
  -3                                                    y = 8 · 3−(−3) = 8 · 33 = 216
 -2                                                     y = 8 · 3−(−2) = 8 · 32 = 72
 -1                                                     y = 8 · 3−(−1) = 8 · 31 = 24
 0                                                      y = 8 · 30 = 8
 1                                                      y = 8 · 3−1 = 83
 2                                                      y = 8 · 3−2 = 89


**Example 7**

Graph the functions y = 4 x and y = 4−x on the same coordinate axes.

**Solution:**

Here is the table of values for the two functions. Looking at the values in the table, we can see that the two
functions are “backwards” of each other, in the sense that the values for the two functions are reciprocals.

                                                Table 8.7:

 x                                   y = 4x                                y = 4−x
  -3                                 y = 4−3 = 641
                                                                           y = 4−(−3) = 64
 -2                                  y = 4−2 = 161
                                                                           y = 4−(−2) = 16

                                     y=4 = 4    1
                                                                           y = 4−(−1) = 4
 0                                   y = 40 = 1                            y = 40 = 1
 1                                   y = 41 = 4                            y = 4−1 = 14
 2                                   y = 42 = 16                           y = 4−2 = 161

                                     y = 43 = 64                           y = 4−3 = 641


Here is the graph of the two functions. Notice that the two functions are mirror images of each other if
the mirror is placed vertically on the y−axis.

In the next lesson, you’ll see how exponential growth and decay functions can be used to represent situations
in the real world.

- Solve real-world problems involving exponential decay.


Introduction
For her eighth birthday, Shelley’s grandmother gave her a full bag of candy. Shelley counted her candy
and found out that there were 160 pieces in the bag. As you might suspect, Shelley loves candy, so she ate
half the candy on the ﬁrst day. Then her mother told her that if she eats it at that rate, the candy will
only last one more day—so Shelley devised a clever plan. She will always eat half of the candy that is left
in the bag each day. She thinks that this way she can eat candy every day and never run out.
How much candy does Shelley have at the end of the week? Will the candy really last forever?
Let’s make a table of values for this problem.

       Day                   0         1         2          3        4        5        6          7
       # of candies        160        80         40         20      10        5       2.5        1.25

You can see that if Shelley eats half the candies each day, then by the end of the week she only has 1.25
candies left in her bag.
Let’s write an equation for this exponential function. Using the formula y = A · b x , we( can
                                                                                            ) x see that A is
160 (the number of candies she starts out with and b is 12 , so our equation is y = 160 · 12 .)
Now let’s graph this function. The resulting graph is shown below.


So, will Shelley’s candy last forever? We saw that by the end of the week she has 1.25 candies left, so
there doesn’t seem to be much hope for that. But if you look at the graph, you’ll see that the graph never
really gets to zero. Theoretically there will always be some candy left, but Shelley will be eating very tiny
fractions of a candy every day after the ﬁrst week!
This is a fundamental feature of an exponential decay function. Its values get smaller and smaller but
never quite reach zero. In mathematics, we say that the function has an asymptote at y = 0; in other

words, it gets closer and closer to the line y = 0 but never quite meets it.


Problem-Solving Strategies
Remember our problem-solving plan from earlier?

   1. Understand the problem.
   2. Devise a plan – Translate.
   3. Carry out the plan – Solve.
   4. Look – Check and Interpret.

We can use this plan to solve application problems involving exponential functions. Compound interest,
loudness of sound, population increase, population decrease or radioactive decay are all applications of
exponential functions. In these problems, we’ll use the methods of constructing a table and identifying a
pattern to help us devise a plan for solving the problems.

Suppose $4000 is invested at 6% interest compounded annually. How much money will there be in the bank
at the end of 5 years? At the end of 20 years?

**Solution:**

Step 1: Read the problem and summarize the information.
$4000 is invested at 6% interest compounded annually; we want to know how much money we have in ﬁve
years.
Assign variables:
Let x = time in years
Let y = amount of money in investment account
Step 2: Look for a pattern.
We start with $4000 and each year we add 6% interest to the amount in the bank.

             Start:               $4000
                 st
             1 year:              Interest = 4000 × (0.06) = $240
                                  This is added to the previous amount: $4000 + $4000 × (0.06)
                                  = $4000(1 + 0.06)
                                  = $4000(1.06)
                                  = $4240
                 nd
             2        year        Previous amount + interest on the previous amount
                                  = $4240(1 + 0.06)
                                  = $4240(1.06)
                                  = $4494.40

The pattern is that each year we multiply the previous amount by the factor of 1.06.
Let’s ﬁll in a table of values:

      Time (years)                    0         1           2           3          4             5
      Investments amount($)         4000       4240      4494.4      4764.06     5049.90     5352.9

We see that at the end of ﬁve years we have $5352.90 in the investment account.
Step 3: Find a formula.
We were able to ﬁnd the amount after 5 years just by following the pattern, but rather than follow that
pattern for another 15 years, it’s easier to use it to ﬁnd a general formula. Since the original investment is
multiplied by 1.06 each year, we can use exponential notation. Our formula is y = 4000 · (1.06) x , where x
is the number of years since the investment.
To ﬁnd the amount after 5 years we plug x = 5 into the equation:

                                           y = 4000 · (1.06)5 = $5352.90

To ﬁnd the amount after 20 years we plug x = 20 into the equation:

                                          y = 4000 · (1.06)20 = $12828.54

Step 4: Check.
Looking back over the solution, we see that we obtained the answers to the questions we were asked and
the answers make sense.
To check our answers, we can plug some low values of x into the formula to see if they match the values in
the table:
x = 0 : y = 4000 · (1.06)0 = 4000
x = 1 : y = 4000 · (1.06)1 = 4240
x = 2 : y = 4000 · (1.06)2 = 4494.4
The answers match the values we found earlier. The amount of increase gets larger each year, and that
makes sense because the interest is 6% of an amount that is larger every year.

**Example 2**

In 2002 the population of schoolchildren in a city was 90,000. This population decreases at a rate of 5%
each year. What will be the population of school children in year 2010?

**Solution:**

Step 1: Read the problem and summarize the information.
The population is 90,000; the rate of decrease is 5% each year; we want the population after 8 years.
Assign variables:
Let x = time since 2002 (in years)
Let y = population of school children
Step 2: Look for a pattern.
Let’s start in 2002, when the population is 90,000.
The rate of decrease is 5% each year, so the amount in 2003 is 90,000 minus 5% of 90,000, or 95% of 90,000.

                              In 2003 :         Population = 90, 000 × 0.95
                              In 2004 :         Population = 90, 000 × 0.95 × 0.95

The pattern is that for each year we multiply by a factor of 0.95
Let’s ﬁll in a table of values:

       Year               2002           2003           2004         2005          2006        2007
       Population        90, 000         85, 500       81, 225      77, 164       73, 306      69, 640

Step 3: Find a formula.
Since we multiply by 0.95 every year, our exponential formula is y = 90000 · (0.95) x , where x is the number
of years since 2002. To ﬁnd the population in 2010 (8 years after 2002), we plug in x = 8:
y = 90000 · (0.95)8 = 59, 708 schoolchildren.
Step 4: Check.
Looking back over the solution, we see that we answered the question we were asked and that it makes
sense. The answer makes sense because the numbers decrease each year as we expected. We can check
that the formula is correct by plugging in the values of x from the table to see if the values match those
given by the formula.

                    Year 2002, x = 0 :          Population = y = 90000 · (0.95)0 = 90, 000
                    Year 2003, x = 1 :          Population = y = 90000 · (0.95)1 = 85, 500
                    Year 2004, x = 2 :          Population = y = 90000 · (0.95)2 = 81, 225


Solve Real-World Problems Involving Exponential Growth
Now we’ll look at some more real-world problems involving exponential functions. We’ll start with situa-
tions involving exponential growth.

**Example 3**

The population of a town is estimated to increase by 15% per year. The population today is 20 thousand.
Make a graph of the population function and ﬁnd out what the population will be ten years from now.

**Solution:**

First, we need to write a function that describes the population of the town.
The general form of an exponential function is y = A · b x .
Deﬁne y as the population of the town.
Deﬁne x as the number of years from now.
A is the initial population, so A = 20 (thousand).
Finally we must ﬁnd what b is. We are told that the population increases by 15% each year. To calculate
percents we have to change them into decimals: 15% is equivalent to 0.15. So each year, the population
increases by 15% of A, or 0.15A.
To ﬁnd the total population for the following year, we must add the current population to the increase in
population. In other words, A + 0.15A = 1.15A. So the population must be multiplied by a factor of 1.15
each year. This means that the base of the exponential is b = 1.15.
The formula that describes this problem is y = 20 · (1.15) x .
Now let’s make a table of values.


                                                 Table 8.8:

 x                                                      y = 20 · (1.15) x
  -10                                                   4.9
 -5                                                     9.9
 0                                                      20
 5                                                      40.2
 10                                                     80.9


Now we can graph the function.


Notice that we used negative values of x in our table of values. Does it make sense to think of negative
time? Yes; negative time can represent time in the past. For example, x = −5 in this problem represents
the population from ﬁve years ago.
The question asked in the problem was: what will be the population of the town ten years from now? To
ﬁnd that number, we plug x = 10 into the equation we found: y = 20 · (1.15)10 = 80, 911.
The town will have 80,911 people ten years from now.

**Example 4**

Peter earned $1500 last summer. If he deposited the money in a bank account that earns 5% interest
compounded yearly, how much money will he have after ﬁve years?

**Solution:**

This problem deals with interest which is compounded yearly. This means that each year the interest is
calculated on the amount of money you have in the bank. That interest is added to the original amount
and next year the interest is calculated on this new amount, so you get paid interest on the interest.
Let’s write a function that describes the amount of money in the bank.
The general form of an exponential function is y = A · b x .
Deﬁne y as the amount of money in the bank.
Deﬁne x as the number of years from now.
A is the initial amount, so A = 1500.
Now we have to ﬁnd what b is.

We’re told that the interest is 5% each year, which is 0.05 in decimal form. When we add 0.05A to A, we
get 1.05A, so that is the factor we multiply by each year. The base of the exponential is b = 1.05.
The formula that describes this problem is y = 1500 · 1.05 x . To ﬁnd the total amount of money in the bank
at the end of ﬁve years, we simply plug in x = 5.

                                        y = 1500 · (1.05)5 = $1914.42


Solve Real-World Problems Involving Exponential Decay
Exponential decay problems appear in several application problems. Some examples of these are half-life
problems and depreciation problems. Let’s solve an example of each of these problems.

**Example 5**

A radioactive substance has a half-life of one week. In other words, at the end of every week the level of
radioactivity is half of its value at the beginning of the week. The initial level of radioactivity is 20 counts
per second.
Draw the graph of the amount of radioactivity against time in weeks.
Find the formula that gives the radioactivity in terms of time.
Find the radioactivity left after three weeks.

**Solution:**

Let’s start by making a table of values and then draw the graph.

                                                 Table 8.9:

 Time                                                    Radioactivity
 0                                                       20
 1                                                       10
 2                                                       5
 3                                                       2.5
 4                                                       1.25
 5                                                       0.625


Exponential decay ﬁts the general formula y = A · b x . In this case:
y is the amount of radioactivity
x is the time in weeks
A = 20 is the starting amount
b = 12 since the substance losses half its value each week
                                          ( )x
The formula for this problem is y = 20 · 21 or y = 20 · 2−x . To ﬁnd out how much radioactivity is left after
three weeks, we plug x = 3 into this formula.
                                                   ( 1 )3            (1)
                                        y = 20 ·            = 20 ·         = 2.5
                                                    2                8


**Example 6**

The cost of a new car is $32,000. It depreciates at a rate of 15% per year. This means that it loses 15%
of each value each year.
Draw the graph of the car’s value against time in year.
Find the formula that gives the value of the car in terms of time.
Find the value of the car when it is four years old.

**Solution:**

Let’s start by making a table of values. To ﬁll in the values we start with 32,000 at time t = 0. Then
we multiply the value of the car by 85% for each passing year. (Since the car loses 15% of its value, that
means it keeps 85% of its value). Remember that 85% means that we multiply by the decimal .85.

                                                   Table 8.10:

 Time                                                         Value (thousands)
 0                                                            32
 1                                                            27.2
 2                                                            23.1
 3                                                            19.7
 4                                                            16.7
 5                                                            14.2


Now draw the graph:

Let’s start with the general formula y = A · b x
In this case:
y is the value of the car,
x is the time in years,
A = 32 is the starting amount in thousands,
b = 0.85 since we multiply the amount by this factor to get the value of the car next year
The formula for this problem is y = 32 · (0.85) x .
Finally, to ﬁnd the value of the car when it is four years old, we plug x = 4 into that formula: y =
32 · (0.85)4 = 16.7 thousand dollars, or $16,704 if we don’t round.

# Chapter 9: Polynomials


## 9.1 Addition and Subtraction of Polynomials


### Learning Objectives

- Write a polynomial expression in standard form.
- Classify polynomial expression by degree.
- Add and subtract polynomials.
- Solve problems using addition and subtraction of polynomials.


Introduction
So far we’ve seen functions described by straight lines (linear functions) and functions where the variable
appeared in the exponent (exponential functions). In this section we’ll introduce polynomial functions. A
polynomial is made up of diﬀerent terms that contain positive integer powers of the variables. Here is
an example of a polynomial:


                                              4x3 + 2x2 − 3x + 1


Each part of the polynomial that is added or subtracted is called a term of the polynomial. The example
above is a polynomial with four terms.
The numbers appearing in each term in front of the variable are called the coeﬀicients. The number
appearing all by itself without a variable is called a constant.


In this case the coeﬀicient of x3 is 4, the coeﬀicient of x2 is 2, the coeﬀicient of x is -3 and the constant is
1.

Degrees of Polynomials and Standard Form
Each term in the polynomial has a diﬀerent degree. The degree of the term is the power of the variable
in that term.

             4x3                has degree 3 and is called a cubic term or 3rd order term.
             2x2                has degree 2 and is called a quadratic term or 2nd order term.
              − 3x              has degree 1 and is called a linear term or 1 st order term.
             1                  has degree 0 and is called the constant.

By deﬁnition, the degree of the polynomial is the same as the degree of the term with the highest
degree. This example is a polynomial of degree 3, which is also called a “cubic” polynomial. (Why do you
think it is called a cubic?).
Polynomials can have more than one variable. Here is another example of a polynomial:

                                         t4 − 6s3 t2 − 12st + 4s4 − 5

This is a polynomial because all the exponents on the variables are positive integers. This polynomial has
ﬁve terms. Let’s look at each term more closely.
Note: The degree of a term is the sum of the powers on each variable in the term. In other words, the
degree of each term is the number of variables that are multiplied together in that term, whether those
variables are the same or diﬀerent.

                     t4                       has a degree of 4, so it’s a 4th order term
                     − 6s3 t2                 has a degree of 5, so it’s a 5th order term.
                     − 12st                   has a degree of 2, so it’s a 2nd order term.
                     4s4                      has a degree of 4, so it’s a 4th order term.
                     −5                       is a constant, so its degree is 0.

Since the highest degree of a term in this polynomial is 5, then this is polynomial of degree 5th or a 5th
order polynomial.
A polynomial that has only one term has a special name. It is called a monomial (mono means one). A
monomial can be a constant, a variable, or a product of a constant and one or more variables. You can
see that each term in a polynomial is a monomial, so a polynomial is just the sum of several monomials.
Here are some examples of monomials:
                                                            1 4
                                  b2      − 2ab2     8        x         − 29xy


**Example 1**

For the following polynomials, identify the coeﬀicient of each term, the constant, the degree of each term
and the degree of the polynomial.
a) x5 − 3x3 + 4x2 − 5x + 7
b) x4 − 3x3 y2 + 8x − 12

**Solution:**

a) x5 − 3x3 + 4x2 − 5x + 7

The coeﬀicients of each term in order are 1, -3, 4, and -5 and the constant is 7.
The degrees of each term are 5, 3, 2, 1, and 0. Therefore the degree of the polynomial is 5.
b) x4 − 3x3 y2 + 8x − 12
The coeﬀicients of each term in order are 1, -3, and 8 and the constant is -12.
The degrees of each term are 4, 5, 1, and 0. Therefore the degree of the polynomial is 5.

**Example 2**

Identify the following expressions as polynomials or non-polynomials.
a) 5x5 − 2x
b) 3x2 − 2x−2
    √
c) x x − 1
d) x35+1
e) 4x 3
f) 4xy2 − 2x2 y − 3 + y3 − 3x3

**Solution:**

a) This is a polynomial.
b) This is not a polynomial because it has a negative exponent.
c) This is not a polynomial because it has a radical.
d) This is not a polynomial because the power of x appears in the denominator of a fraction (and there is
no way to rewrite it so that it does not).
e) This is not a polynomial because it has a fractional exponent.
f) This is a polynomial.
Often, we arrange the terms in a polynomial in order of decreasing power. This is called standard form.
The following polynomials are in standard form:

                                          4x4 − 3x3 + 2x2 − x + 1


                                      a4 b3 − 2a3 b3 + 3a4 b − 5ab2 + 2

The ﬁrst term of a polynomial in standard form is called the leading term, and the coeﬀicient of the
leading term is called the leading coeﬀicient.
The ﬁrst polynomial above has the leading term 4x4 , and the leading coeﬀicient is 4.
The second polynomial above has the leading term a4 b3 , and the leading coeﬀicient is 1.

**Example 3**

Rearrange the terms in the following polynomials so that they are in standard form. Indicate the leading
term and leading coeﬀicient of each polynomial.
a) 7 − 3x3 + 4x
b) ab − a3 + 2b
c) −4b + 4 + b2

**Solution:**


a) 7 − 3x3 + 4x becomes −3x3 + 4x + 7. Leading term is −3x3 ; leading coeﬀicient is -3.
b) ab − a3 + 2b becomes −a3 + ab + 2b. Leading term is −a3 ; leading coeﬀicient is -1.
c) −4b + 4 + b2 becomes b2 − 4b + 4. Leading term is b2 ; leading coeﬀicient is 1.


Simplifying Polynomials
A polynomial is simpliﬁed if it has no terms that are alike. Like terms are terms in the polynomial that
have the same variable(s) with the same exponents, whether they have the same or diﬀerent coeﬀicients.
For example, 2x2 y and 5x2 y are like terms, but 6x2 y and 6xy2 are not like terms.
When a polynomial has like terms, we can simplify it by combining those terms.

                                                x2 + 6xy − 4xy + y2
                                                     ↗      ↖
                                                    Like terms

We can simplify this polynomial by combining the like terms 6xy and −4xy into (6 − 4)xy, or 2xy. The new
polynomial is x2 + 2xy + y2 .

**Example 4**

Simplify the following polynomials by collecting like terms and combining them.
a) 2x − 4x2 + 6 + x2 − 4 + 4x
b) a3 b3 − 5ab4 + 2a3 b − a3 b3 + 3ab4 − a2 b

**Solution:**

a) Rearrange the terms so that like terms are grouped together: (−4x2 + x2 ) + (2x + 4x) + (6 − 4)
Combine each set of like terms: −3x2 + 6x + 2
b) Rearrange the terms so that like terms are grouped together: (a3 b3 − a3 b3 ) + (−5ab4 + 3ab4 ) + 2a3 b − a2 b
Combine each set of like terms: 0 − 2ab4 + 2a3 b − a2 b = −2ab4 + 2a3 b − a2 b


Adding and Subtracting Polynomials
To add two or more polynomials, write their sum and then simplify by combining like terms.

**Example 5**

Add and simplify the resulting polynomials.
a) Add 3x2 − 4x + 7 and 2x3 − 4x2 − 6x + 5
b) Add x2 − 2xy + y2 and 2y2 − 3x2 and 10xy + y3

**Solution:**

a)
                                            (3x2 − 4x + 7) + (2x3 − 4x2 − 6x + 5)
                        Group like terms: = 2x3 + (3x2 − 4x2 ) + (−4x − 6x) + (7 + 5)
                                  Simplify: = 2x3 − x2 − 10x + 12

b)

                                             (x2 − 2xy + y2 ) + (2y2 − 3x2 ) + (10xy + y3 )
                       Group like terms: = (x2 − 3x2 ) + (y2 + 2y2 ) + (−2xy + 10xy) + y3
                                Simplify: = −2x2 + 3y2 + 8xy + y3


To subtract one polynomial from another, add the opposite of each term of the polynomial you are sub-
tracting.

**Example 6**

a) Subtract x3 − 3x2 + 8x + 12 from 4x2 + 5x − 9
b) Subtract 5b2 − 2a2 from 4a2 − 8ab − 9b2

**Solution:**

a)
             (4x2 + 5x − 9) − (x3 − 3x2 + 8x + 12) = (4x2 + 5x − 9) + (−x3 + 3x2 − 8x − 12)
                                    Group like terms: = −x3 + (4x2 + 3x2 ) + (5x − 8x) + (−9 − 12)
                                              Simplify: = −x3 + 7x2 − 3x − 21


b)
                       (4a2 − 8ab − 9b2 ) − (5b2 − 2a2 ) = (4a2 − 8ab − 9b2 ) + (−5b2 + 2a2 )
                                     Group like terms: = (4a2 + 2a2 ) + (−9b2 − 5b2 ) − 8ab
                                                Simplify: = 6a2 − 14b2 − 8ab


Note: An easy way to check your work after adding or subtracting polynomials is to substitute a convenient
value in for the variable, and check that your answer and the problem both give the same value. For
example, in part (b) above, if we let a = 2 and b = 3, then we can check as follows:

               Given                                                          Solution
               (4a − 8ab − 9b ) − (5b − 2a )
                  2             2        2       2
                                                                              6a2 − 14b2 − 8ab
               (4(2)2 − 8(2)(3) − 9(3)2 ) − (5(3)2 − 2(2)2 )                  6(2)2 − 14(3)2 − 8(2)(3)
               (4(4) − 8(2)(3) − 9(9)) − (5(9) − 2(4))                        6(4) − 14(9) − 8(2)(3)
               (−113) − 37                                                    24 − 126 − 48
               − 150                                                          − 150


Since both expressions evaluate to the same number when we substitute in arbitrary values for the variables,
we can be reasonably sure that our answer is correct.
Note: When you use this method, do not choose 0 or 1 for checking since these can lead to common
problems.


Problem Solving Using Addition or Subtraction of Polynomials
One way we can use polynomials is to ﬁnd the area of a geometric ﬁgure.

**Example 7**

Write a polynomial that represents the area of each ﬁgure shown.

a)


b)


c)


d)


**Solution:**

a) This shape is formed by two squares and two rectangles.

                                       The blue square has area y × y = y2 .
                                     The yellow square has area x × x = x2 .
                             The pink rectangles each have area x × y = xy.

To ﬁnd the total area of the ﬁgure we add all the separate areas:

                                     T otal area = y2 + x2 + xy + xy
                                                = y2 + x2 + 2xy

b) This shape is formed by two squares and one rectangle.

                             The yellow squares each have area a × a = a2 .
                                The orange rectangle has area 2a × b = 2ab.

To ﬁnd the total area of the ﬁgure we add all the separate areas:

                                        T otal area = a2 + a2 + 2ab
                                                     = 2a2 + 2ab

c) To ﬁnd the area of the green region we ﬁnd the area of the big square and subtract the area of the little
square.

                                  The big square has area : y × y = y2 .
                                The little square has area : x × x = x2 .
                                        Area o f the green region = y2 − x2

d) To ﬁnd the area of the ﬁgure we can ﬁnd the area of the big rectangle and add the areas of the pink
squares.

                               The pink squares each have area a × a = a2 .
                                  The blue rectangle has area 3a × a = 3a2 .

To ﬁnd the total area of the ﬁgure we add all the separate areas:

                                  T otal area = a2 + a2 + a2 + 3a2 = 6a2

Another way to ﬁnd this area is to ﬁnd the area of the big square and subtract the areas of the three yellow
squares:


                                      The big square has area 3a × 3a = 9a2 .
                              The yellow squares each have area a × a = a2 .

To ﬁnd the total area of the ﬁgure we subtract:

                                        Area = 9a2 − (a2 + a2 + a2 )
                                             = 9a2 − 3a2
                                             = 6a2

## 9.2 Multiplication of Polynomials


### Learning Objectives

- Multiply a polynomial by a monomial.
- Multiply a polynomial by a binomial.
- Solve problems using multiplication of polynomials.


Introduction
Just as we can add and subtract polynomials, we can also multiply them. The Distributive Property and
the techniques you’ve learned for dealing with exponents will be useful here.


Multiplying a Polynomial by a Monomial
When multiplying polynomials, we must remember the exponent rules that we learned in the last chapter.
Especially important is the product rule: xn · xm = xn+m .
If the expressions we are multiplying have coeﬀicients and more than one variable, we multiply the coeﬀi-
cients just as we would any number and we apply the product rule on each variable separately.

**Example 1**

Multiply the following monomials.
a) (2x2 )(5x3 )
b) (−3y4 )(2y2 )
c) (3xy5 )(−6x4 y2 )

d) (−12a2 b3 c4 )(−3a2 b2 )

**Solution:**

a) (2x2 )(5x3 ) = (2 · 5) · (x2 · x3 ) = 10x2+3 = 10x5
b) (−3y4 )(2y2 ) = (−3 · 2) · (y4 · y2 ) = −6y4+2 = −6y6
c) (3xy5 )(−6x4 y2 ) = −18x1+4 y5+2 = −18x5 y7
d) (−12a2 b3 c4 )(−3a2 b2 ) = 36a2+2 b3+2 c4 = 36a4 b5 c4
To multiply a polynomial by a monomial, we have to use the Distributive Property. Remember, that
property says that a(b + c) = ab + ac.

**Example 2**

Multiply:
a) 3(x2 + 3x − 5)
b) 4x(3x2 − 7)
c) −7y(4y2 − 2y + 1)

**Solution:**

a) 3(x2 + 3x − 5) = 3(x2 ) + 3(3x) − 3(5) = 3x2 + 9x − 15
b) 4x(3x2 − 7) = (4x)(3x2 ) + (4x)(−7) = 12x3 − 28x
c) −7y(4y2 − 2y + 1) = (−7y)(4y2 ) + (−7y)(−2y) + (−7y)(1) = −28y3 + 14y2 − 7y
Notice that when we use the Distributive Property, the problem becomes a matter of just multiplying
monomials by monomials and adding all the separate parts together.

**Example 3**

Multiply:
a) 2x3 (−3x4 + 2x3 − 10x2 + 7x + 9)
b) −7a2 bc3 (5a2 − 3b2 − 9c2 )

**Solution:**

a) 2x3 (−3x4 + 2x3 − 10x2 + 7x + 9) = (2x3 )(−3x4 ) + (2x3 )(2x3 ) + (2x3 )(−10x2 ) + (2x3 )(7x) + (2x3 )(9)
                                         = −6x7 + 4x6 − 20x5 + 14x4 + 18x3

b)            −7a2 bc3 (5a2 − 3b2 − 9c2 ) = (−7a2 bc3 )(5a2 ) + (−7a2 bc3 )(−3b2 ) + (−7a2 bc3 )(−9c2 )
                                          = −35a4 bc3 + 21a2 b3 c3 + 63a2 bc5


Multiplying Two Polynomials
Let’s start by multiplying two binomials together. A binomial is a polynomial with two terms, so a product
of two binomials will take the form (a + b)(c + d).
We can still use the Distributive Property here if we do it cleverly. First, let’s think of the ﬁrst set of
parentheses as one term. The Distributive Property says that we can multiply that term by c, multiply it
by d, and then add those two products together: (a + b)(c + d) = (a + b) · c + (a + b) · d.
We can rewrite this expression as c(a + b) + d(a + b). Now let’s look at each half separately. We can apply
the distributive property again to each set of parentheses in turn, and that gives us c(a + b) + d(a + b) =
ca + cb + da + db.

What you should notice is that when multiplying any two polynomials, every term in one polynomial is
multiplied by every term in the other polynomial.

**Example 4**

Multiply and simplify: (2x + 1)(x + 3)

**Solution:**

We must multiply each term in the ﬁrst polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. Let’s try to
be systematic to make sure that we get all the products.
First, multiply the ﬁrst term in the ﬁrst set of parentheses by all the terms in the second set of parentheses.


Now we’re done with the ﬁrst term. Next we multiply the second term in the ﬁrst parenthesis by all terms
in the second parenthesis and add them to the previous terms.


Now we’re done with the multiplication and we can simplify:
(2x)(x) + (2x)(3) + (1)(x) + (1)(3) = 2x2 + 6x + x + 3 = 2x2 + 7x + 3
This way of multiplying polynomials is called in-line multiplication or horizontal multiplication. Another
method for multiplying polynomials is to use vertical multiplication, similar to the vertical multiplication
you learned with regular numbers.

**Example 5**

Multiply and simplify:
a) (4x − 5)(x − 20)
b) (3x − 2)(3x + 2)
c) (3x2 + 2x − 5)(2x − 3)
d) (x2 − 9)(4x4 + 5x2 − 2)

**Solution:**

a) With horizontal multiplication this would be

 (4x − 5)(x − 20) = (4x)(x) + (4x)(−20) + (−5)(x) + (−5)(−20) = 4x2 − 80x − 5x + 100 = 4x2 − 85x + 100

To do vertical multiplication instead, we arrange the polynomials on top of each other with like terms in
the same columns:

                                                        4x − 5
                                                         x − 20
                                                     − 80x + 100
                                               4x − 5x

                                               4x2 − 85x + 100

Both techniques result in the same answer: 4x2 − 85x + 100. We’ll use vertical multiplication for the other
problems.

b)
                                                     3x − 2
                                                     3x + 2
                                                     6x − 4
                                               9x2 − 6x
                                               9x2 + 0x − 4


The answer is 9x2 − 4.
c) It’s better to place the smaller polynomial on the bottom:

                                                  3x2 + 2x − 5
                                                          2x − 3
                                               − 9x2 − 6x + 15
                                           6x3 + 4x2 − 10x
                                           6x3 − 5x2 − 16x + 15


The answer is 6x3 − 5x2 − 16x + 15.
d) Set up the multiplication vertically and leave gaps for missing powers of x:

                                                   4x4 + 5x2 − 2
                                                             x2 − 9
                                              − 36x4 − 45x2 + 18
                                          4x6 + 5x4 − 2x2
                                          4x6 − 31x4 − 47x2 + 18


The answer is 4x6 − 31x4 − 47x2 + 18.

two binomials together is related to the distributive property.


Solve Real-World Problems Using Multiplication of Polynomials
In this section, we’ll see how multiplication of polynomials is applied to ﬁnding the areas and volumes of
geometric shapes.

**Example 6**

Find the areas of the following ﬁgures:
a)


b)


Find the volumes of the following ﬁgures:
c)


d)


**Solution:**

a) We use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = length × width.
For the big rectangle:

                                     Length = b + 3, Width = b + 2
                                       Area = (b + 3)(b + 2)
                                             = b2 + 2b + 3b + 6
                                             = b2 + 5b + 6

b) We could add up the areas of the blue and orange rectangles, but it’s easier to just ﬁnd the area of the
whole big rectangle and subtract the area of the yellow rectangle.


                                Area of big rectangle = 20(12) = 240
                            Area of yellow rectangle = (12 − x)(20 − 2x)
                                                      = 240 − 24x − 20x + 2x2
                                                      = 240 − 44x + 2x2
                                                      = 2x2 − 44x + 240

The desired area is the diﬀerence between the two:

                                    Area = 240 − (2x2 − 44x + 240)
                                            = 240 + (−2x2 + 44x − 240)
                                            = 240 − 2x2 + 44x − 240
                                            = −2x2 + 44x

c) The volume of this shape = (area of the base)(height).

                                 Area of the base = x(x + 2)
                                                    = x2 + 2x
                                             Height = 2x + 1
                                            Volume = (x2 + 2x)(2x + 1)
                                                    = 2x3 + x2 + 4x2 + 2x
                                                    = 2x3 + 5x2 + 2x

d) The volume of this shape = (area of the base)(height).

                                Area of the base = (4a − 3)(2a + 1)
                                                   = 8a2 + 4a − 6a − 3
                                                   = 8a2 − 2a − 3
                                             Height = a + 4
                                            Volume = (8a2 − 2a − 3)(a + 4)

Let’s multiply using the vertical method:

                                                    8a2 − 2a − 3
                                                           a+4
                                                   32a − 8a − 12

                                            8a − 2a2 − 3a

                                            8a3 + 30a2 − 11a − 12

The volume is 8a3 + 30a2 − 11a − 12.

## 9.3 Special Products of Polynomials


### Learning Objectives

- Find the square of a binomial
- Find the product of binomials using sum and diﬀerence formula
- Solve problems using special products of polynomials


Introduction
We saw that when we multiply two binomials we need to make sure to multiply each term in the ﬁrst
binomial with each term in the second binomial. Let’s look at another example.
Multiply two linear binomials (binomials whose degree is 1):

                                              (2x + 3)(x + 4)

When we multiply, we obtain a quadratic polynomial (one with degree 2) with four terms:

                                            2x2 + 8x + 3x + 12

The middle terms are like terms and we can combine them. We simplify and get 2x2 + 11x + 12. This is a
quadratic, or second-degree, trinomial (polynomial with three terms).
You can see that every time we multiply two linear binomials with one variable, we will obtain a quadratic
polynomial. In this section we’ll talk about some special products of binomials.


Find the Square of a Binomial
One special binomial product is the square of a binomial. Consider the product (x + 4)(x + 4).
Since we are multiplying the same expression by itself, that means we are squaring the expression. (x +
4)(x + 4) is the same as (x + 4)2 .
When we multiply it out, we get x2 + 4x + 4x + 16, which simpliﬁes to x2 + 8x + 16.
Notice that the two middle terms—the ones we added together to get 8x—were the same. Is this a
coincidence? In order to ﬁnd that out, let’s square a general linear binomial.

                               (a + b)2 = (a + b)(a + b) = a2 + ab + ab + b2
                                       = a2 + 2ab + b2

Sure enough, the middle terms are the same. How about if the expression we square is a diﬀerence instead
of a sum?

                               (a − b)2 = (a − b)(a − b) = a2 − ab − ab + b2
                                        = a2 − 2ab + b2

It looks like the middle two terms are the same in general whenever we square a binomial. The general
pattern is: to square a binomial, take the square of the ﬁrst term, add or subtract twice the product of the
terms, and add the square of the second term. You should remember these formulas:

                                          (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
                                                     and
                                          (a − b) = a2 − 2ab + b2


Remember! Raising a polynomial to a power means that we multiply the polynomial by itself however
many times the exponent indicates. For instance, (a + b)2 = (a + b)(a + b). Don’t make the common
mistake of thinking that (a + b)2 = a2 + b2 ! To see why that’s not true, try substituting numbers for
a and b into the equation (for example, a = 4 and b = 3), and you will see that it is not a true statement.
The middle term, 2ab, is needed to make the equation work.
We can apply the formulas for squaring binomials to any number of problems.

**Example 1**

Square each binomial and simplify.
a) (x + 10)2
b) (2x − 3)2
c) (x2 + 4)2
d) (5x − 2y)2

**Solution:**

Let’s use the square of a binomial formula to multiply each expression.
a) (x + 10)2
If we let a = x and b = 10, then our formula (a+b)2 = a2 +2ab+b2 becomes (x+10)2 = x2 +2(x)(10)+102 ,
which simpliﬁes to x2 + 20x + 100.
b) (2x − 3)2
If we let a = 2x and b = 3, then our formula (a−b)2 = a2 −2ab+b2 becomes (2x−3)2 = (2x2 )−2(2x)(3)+(3)2 ,
which simpliﬁes to 4x2 − 12x + 9.
c) (x2 + 4)2
If we let a = x2 and b = 4, then

                                     (x2 + 4)2 = (x2 )2 + 2(x2 )(4) + (4)2
                                               = x4 + 8x2 + 16

d) (5x − 2y)2
If we let a = 5x and b = 2y, then

                                    (5x − 2y)2 = (5x)2 − 2(5x)(2y) + (2y)2
                                              = 25x2 − 20xy + 4y2


Find the Product of Binomials Using Sum and Diﬀerence Pat-
terns
Another special binomial product is the product of a sum and a diﬀerence of terms. For example, let’s
multiply the following binomials.

                                    (x + 4)(x − 4) = x2 − 4x + 4x − 16
                                                  = x2 − 16

Notice that the middle terms are opposites of each other, so they cancel out when we collect like terms.
This is not a coincidence. This always happens when we multiply a sum and diﬀerence of the same terms.
In general,

                                    (a + b)(a − b) = a2 − ab + ab − b2
                                                  = a2 − b2

When multiplying a sum and diﬀerence of the same two terms, the middle terms cancel out. We get the
square of the ﬁrst term minus the square of the second term. You should remember this formula.
Sum and Diﬀerence Formula: (a + b)(a − b) = a2 − b2
Let’s apply this formula to a few examples.

**Example 2**

Multiply the following binomials and simplify.
a) (x + 3)(x − 3)
b) (5x + 9)(5x − 9)
c) (2x3 + 7)(2x3 − 7)
d) (4x + 5y)(4x − 5y)

**Solution:**

a) Let a = x and b = 3, then:

                                         (a + b)(a − b) = a2 − b2
                                         (x + 3)(x − 3) = x2 − 32
                                                        = x2 − 9

b) Let a = 5x and b = 9, then:

                                         (a + b)(a − b) = a2 − b2
                                      (5x + 9)(5x − 9) = (5x)2 − 92
                                                       = 25x2 − 81

c) Let a = 2x3 and b = 7, then:

                                    (2x3 + 7)(2x3 − 7) = (2x3 )2 − (7)2
                                                       = 4x6 − 49

d) Let a = 4x and b = 5y, then:

                                    (4x + 5y)(4x − 5y) = (4x)2 − (5y)2
                                                       = 16x2 − 25y2

Solve Real-World Problems Using Special Products of Polynomi-
als

Now let’s see how special products of polynomials apply to geometry problems and to mental arithmetic.

**Example 3**

Find the area of the following square:


**Solution:**

The length of each side is (a + b), so the area is (a + b)(a + b).
Notice that this gives a visual explanation of the square of a binomial. The blue square has area a2 , the
red square has area b2 , and each rectangle has area ab, so added all together, the area (a + b)(a + b) is
equal to a2 + 2ab + b2 .
The next example shows how you can use the special products to do fast mental calculations.

**Example 4**

Use the diﬀerence of squares and the binomial square formulas to ﬁnd the products of the following numbers
without using a calculator.
a) 43 × 57
b) 112 × 88
c) 452
d) 481 × 319

**Solution:**

The key to these mental “tricks” is to rewrite each number as a sum or diﬀerence of numbers you know
how to square easily.
a) Rewrite 43 as (50 − 7) and 57 as (50 + 7).
Then 43 × 57 = (50 − 7)(50 + 7) = (50)2 − (7)2 = 2500 − 49 = 2451
b) Rewrite 112 as (100 + 12) and 88 as (100 − 12).
Then 112 × 88 = (100 + 12)(100 − 12) = (100)2 − (12)2 = 10000 − 144 = 9856
c) 452 = (40 + 5)2 = (40)2 + 2(40)(5) + (5)2 = 1600 + 400 + 25 = 2025
d) Rewrite 481 as (400 + 81) and 319 as (400 − 81).
Then 481 × 319 = (400 + 81)(400 − 81) = (400)2 − (81)2
(400)2 is easy - it equals 160000.
(81)2 is not easy to do mentally, so let’s rewrite 81 as 80 + 1.
(81)2 = (80 + 1)2 = (80)2 + 2(80)(1) + (1)2 = 6400 + 160 + 1 = 6561

Then 481 × 319 = (400)2 − (81)2 = 160000 − 6561 = 153439

## 9.4 Polynomial Equations in Factored Form


### Learning Objectives

- Use the zero-product property.
- Find greatest common monomial factors.
- Solve simple polynomial equations by factoring.


Introduction
In the last few sections, we learned how to multiply polynomials by using the Distributive Property. All
the terms in one polynomial had to be multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. In this section,
you’ll start learning how to do this process in reverse. The reverse of distribution is called factoring.


The total area of the ﬁgure above can be found in two ways.
We could ﬁnd the areas of all the small rectangles and add them: ab + ac + ad + ae + 2a.
Or, we could ﬁnd the area of the big rectangle all at once. Its width is a and its length is b + c + d + e + 2,
so its area is a(b + c + d + e + 2).
Since the area of the rectangle is the same no matter what method we use, those two expressions must be
equal.

                               ab + ac + ad + ae + 2a = a(b + c + d + e + 2)

To turn the right-hand side of this equation into the left-hand side, we would use the distributive property.
To turn the left-hand side into the right-hand side, we would need to factor it. Since polynomials can be
multiplied just like numbers, they can also be factored just like numbers—and we’ll see later how this can
help us solve problems.


Find the Greatest Common Monomial Factor
You will be learning several factoring methods in the next few sections. In most cases, factoring takes
several steps to complete because we want to factor completely. That means that we factor until we
can’t factor any more.
Let’s start with the simplest step: ﬁnding the greatest monomial factor. When we want to factor, we
always look for common monomials ﬁrst. Consider the following polynomial, written in expanded form:

                                                ax + bx + cx + dx

A common factor is any factor that appears in all terms of the polynomial; it can be a number, a variable
or a combination of numbers and variables. Notice that in our example, the factor x appears in all terms,
so it is a common factor.
To factor out the x, we write it outside a set of parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we write what’s left
when we divide each term by x:

                                                 x(a + b + c + d)

Let’s look at more examples.

**Example 1**

Factor:
a) 2x + 8
b) 15x − 25
c) 3a + 9b + 6

**Solution:**

a) We see that the factor 2 divides evenly into both terms: 2x + 8 = 2(x) + 2(4)
We factor out the 2 by writing it in front of a parenthesis: 2( )
Inside the parenthesis we write what is left of each term when we divide by 2: 2(x + 4)
b) We see that the factor of 5 divides evenly into all terms: 15x − 25 = 5(3x) − 5(5)
Factor out the 5 to get: 5(3x − 5)
c) We see that the factor of 3 divides evenly into all terms: 3a + 9b + 6 = 3(a) + 3(3b) + 3(2)
Factor 3 to get: 3(a + 3b + 2)

**Example 2**

Find the greatest common factor:
a) a3 − 3a2 + 4a
b) 12a4 − 5a3 + 7a2

**Solution:**

a) Notice that the factor a appears in all terms of a3 − 3a2 + 4a, but each term has a raised to a diﬀerent
power. The greatest common factor of all the terms is simply a.
So ﬁrst we rewrite a3 − 3a2 + 4a as a(a2 ) + a(−3a) + a(4).
Then we factor out the a to get a(a2 − 3a + 4).
b) The factor a appears in all the terms, and it’s always raised to at least the second power. So the greatest
common factor of all the terms is a2 .
We rewrite the expression 12a4 − 5a3 + 7a2 as (12a2 · a2 ) − (5a · a2 ) + (7 · a2 )
Factor out the a2 to get a2 (12a2 − 5a + 7).

**Example 3**

Factor completely:

a) 3ax + 9a
b) x3 y + xy
c) 5x3 y − 15x2 y2 + 25xy3

**Solution:**

a) Both terms have a common factor of 3, but they also have a common factor of a. It’s simplest to factor
these both out at once, which gives us 3a(x + 3).
b) Both x and y are common factors. When we factor them both out at once, we get xy(x2 + 1).
c) The common factors are 5, x, and y. Factoring out 5xy gives us 5xy(x2 − 3xy + 5xy2 ).


Use the Zero-Product Property
The most useful thing about factoring is that we can use it to help solve polynomial equations.
For example, consider an equation like 2x2 + 5x − 42 = 0. There’s no good way to isolate x in this equation,
so we can’t solve it using any of the techniques we’ve already learned. But the left-hand side of the equation
can be factored, making the equation (x + 6)(2x − 7) = 0.
How is this helpful? The answer lies in a useful property of multiplication: if two numbers multiply to
zero, then at least one of those numbers must be zero. This is called the Zero-Product Property.
What does this mean for our polynomial equation? Since the product equals 0, then at least one of the
factors on the left-hand side must equal zero. So we can ﬁnd the two solutions by setting each factor equal
to zero and solving each equation separately.
Setting the factors equal to zero gives us:

                     (x + 6) = 0                    OR                       (2x − 7) = 0

Solving both of those equations gives us:

                      x+6=0                                                  2x − 7 = 0
                      x = −6                        OR                       2x = 7
                                                                              x=

Notice that the solution is x = −6 OR x = 72 . The OR means that either of these values of x would make
the product of the two factors equal to zero. Let’s plug the solutions back into the equation and check
that this is correct.
                       Check : x = −6;                            Check : x =
                       (x + 6)(2x − 7) =                          (x + 6)(2x − 7) =
                                                                  (7       )( 7    )
                       (−6 + 6)(2(−6) − 7) =                          +6 2· −7 =
                                                                    2           2
                                                                  ( 19 )
                       (0)(−19) = 0                                      (7 − 7) =
                                                                  ( 19 )
                                                                         (0) = 0

Factoring a polynomial is very useful because the Zero-Product Property allows us to break up the problem
into simpler separate steps. When we can’t factor a polynomial, the problem becomes harder and we must
use other methods that you will learn later.
As a last note in this section, keep in mind that the Zero-Product Property only works when a product
equals zero. For example, if you multiplied two numbers and the answer was nine, that wouldn’t mean
that one or both of the numbers must be nine. In order to use the property, the factored polynomial must
be equal to zero.

**Example 4**

Solve each equation:
a) (x − 9)(3x + 4) = 0
b) x(5x − 4) = 0
c) 4x(x + 6)(4x − 9) = 0

**Solution:**

Since all the polynomials are in factored form, we can just set each factor equal to zero and solve the
simpler equations separately
a) (x − 9)(3x + 4) = 0 can be split up into two linear equations:

                       x−9=0                                                 3x + 4 = 0
                       x=9                          or                       3x = −4
                                                                             x=−

b) x(5x − 4) = 0 can be split up into two linear equations:

                                                                             5x − 4 = 0
                         x=0                      or                         5x = 4
                                                                             x=

c) 4x(x + 6)(4x − 9) = 0 can be split up into three linear equations:

            4x = 0                             x+6=0                                      4x − 9 = 0
            x=                  or             x = −6                   or                4x = 9
             x=0                                                                          x=


Solve Simple Polynomial Equations by Factoring
Now that we know the basics of factoring, we can solve some simple polynomial equations. We already
saw how we can use the Zero-Product Property to solve polynomials in factored form—now we can use
that knowledge to solve polynomials by factoring them ﬁrst. Here are the steps:
a) If necessary, rewrite the equation in standard form so that the right-hand side equals zero.
b) Factor the polynomial completely.

c) Use the zero-product rule to set each factor equal to zero.
d) Solve each equation from step 3.
e) Check your answers by substituting your solutions into the original equation

**Example 5**

Solve the following polynomial equations.
a) x2 − 2x = 0
b) 2x2 = 5x
c) 9x2 y − 6xy = 0

**Solution:**

a) x2 − 2x = 0
Rewrite: this is not necessary since the equation is in the correct form.
Factor: The common factor is x, so this factors as x(x − 2) = 0.
Set each factor equal to zero:

                       x=0                        or                        x−2=0

Solve:

                       x=0                            or                       x=2

Check: Substitute each solution back into the original equation.

                      x = 0 ⇒ (0)2 − 2(0) = 0                               works out
                      x = 2 ⇒ (2)2 − 2(2) = 4 − 4 = 0                       works out

Answer: x = 0, x = 2
b) 2x2 = 5x
Rewrite: 2x2 = 5x ⇒ 2x2 − 5x = 0
Factor: The common factor is x, so this factors as x(2x − 5) = 0.
Set each factor equal to zero:

                       x=0                       or                         2x − 5 = 0

Solve:

                       x=0                         or                         2x = 5
                                                                              x=

Check: Substitute each solution back into the original equation.

                 x = 0 ⇒ 2(0)2 = 5(0) ⇒ 0 = 0                                     works out
                     5     ( 5 )2    5      25   25   25   25
                 x= ⇒2            =5· ⇒2·      =    ⇒    =                        works out
                     2       2       2       4    2    2   2

Answer: x = 0, x = 52
c) 9x2 y − 6xy = 0
Rewrite: not necessary
Factor: The common factor is 3xy, so this factors as 3xy(3x − 2) = 0.
Set each factor equal to zero:
3 = 0 is never true, so this part does not give a solution. The factors we have left give us:

              x=0                or                y=0              or              3x − 2 = 0

Solve:

               x=0                or               y=0                   or             3x = 2
                                                   x=

Check: Substitute each solution back into the original equation.

               x = 0 ⇒ 9(0)y − 6(0)y = 0 − 0 = 0                                    works out
               y = 0 ⇒ 9x (0) − 6x(0) = 0 − 0 = 0
                                                                                    works out
                   2      ( 2 )2        2       4
               x= ⇒9·            y − 6 · y = 9 · y − 4y = 4y − 4y = 0               works out
                   3        3           3       9

Answer: x = 0, y = 0, x = 23

## 9.5 Factoring Quadratic Expressions


### Learning Objectives

- Write quadratic equations in standard form.
- Factor quadratic expressions for diﬀerent coeﬀicient values.


Write Quadratic Expressions in Standard Form
Quadratic polynomials are polynomials of the 2nd degree. The standard form of a quadratic polynomial
is written as

                                                 ax2 + bx + c

where a, b, and c stand for constant numbers. Factoring these polynomials depends on the values of these
constants. In this section we’ll learn how to factor quadratic polynomials for diﬀerent values of a, b, and c.
(When none of the coeﬀicients are zero, these expressions are also called quadratic trinomials, since they
are polynomials with three terms.)
You’ve already learned how to factor quadratic polynomials where c = 0. For example, for the quadratic
ax2 + bx, the common factor is x and this expression is factored as x(ax + b). Now we’ll see how to factor
quadratics where c is nonzero.


Factor when a = 1, b is Positive, and c is Positive
First, let’s consider the case where a = 1, b is positive and c is positive. The quadratic trinomials will take
the form

                                                 x2 + bx + c

You know from multiplying binomials that when you multiply two factors (x+m)(x+n), you get a quadratic
polynomial. Let’s look at this process in more detail. First we use distribution:

                                    (x + m)(x + n) = x2 + nx + mx + mn

Then we simplify by combining the like terms in the middle. We get:

                                    (x + m)(x + n) = x2 + (n + m)x + mn

So to factor a quadratic, we just need to do this process in reverse.

                             We see that                    x2 + (n + m)x + mn
                             is the same form as            x2 + bx + c

This means that we need to ﬁnd two numbers m and n where

                                   n+m=b              and            mn = c

The factors of x2 + bx + c are always two binomials

                                               (x + m)(x + n)

such that n + m = b and mn = c.

**Example 1**

Factor x2 + 5x + 6.

**Solution:**

We are looking for an answer that is a product of two binomials in parentheses:

                                                (x    )(x   )

We want two numbers m and n that multiply to 6 and add up to 5. A good strategy is to list the possible
ways we can multiply two numbers to get 6 and then see which of these numbers add up to 5:

              6=1·6                 and                1+6=7
              6=2·3                 and                2+3=5          T his is the correct choice.

So the answer is (x + 2)(x + 3).
We can check to see if this is correct by multiplying (x + 2)(x + 3):

                                                       x+2
                                                       x+3
                                                      3x + 6
                                                x + 2x
                                                x2 + 5x + 6

The answer checks out.

**Example 2**

Factor x2 + 7x + 12.

**Solution:**

We are looking for an answer that is a product of two binomials in parentheses: (x          )(x   )
The number 12 can be written as the product of the following numbers:

             12 = 1 · 12             and               1 + 12 = 13
             12 = 2 · 6              and               2+6=8
             12 = 3 · 4              and               3+4=7            T his is the correct choice.

The answer is (x + 3)(x + 4).

**Example 3**

Factor x2 + 8x + 12.

**Solution:**

We are looking for an answer that is a product of two binomials in parentheses: (x     )(x   )
The number 12 can be written as the product of the following numbers:

             12 = 1 · 12             and             1 + 12 = 13
             12 = 2 · 6              and             2+6=8         T his is the correct choice.
             12 = 3 · 4              and             3+4=7

The answer is (x + 2)(x + 6).

**Example 4**

Factor x2 + 12x + 36.

**Solution:**

We are looking for an answer that is a product of two binomials in parentheses: (x     )(x   )
The number 36 can be written as the product of the following numbers:

             36 = 1 · 36             and            1 + 36 = 37
             36 = 2 · 18             and            2 + 18 = 20
             36 = 3 · 12             and            3 + 12 = 15
             36 = 4 · 9              and            4 + 9 = 13
             36 = 6 · 6              and            6 + 6 = 12     T his is the correct choice.

The answer is (x + 6)(x + 6).


Factor when a = 1, b is Negative and c is Positive
Now let’s see how this method works if the middle coeﬀicient is negative.

**Example 5**

Factor x2 − 6x + 8.

**Solution:**

We are looking for an answer that is a product of two binomials in parentheses: (x     )(x   )
When negative coeﬀicients are involved, we have to remember that negative factors may be involved also.
The number 8 can be written as the product of the following numbers:

                                       8=1·8      and     1+8=9

but also

                                8 = (−1) · (−8)   and     − 1 + (−8) = −9

and

                                       8=2·4         and      2+4=6

but also

                  8 = (−2) · (−4)   and      − 2 + (−4) = −6      T his is the correct choice.

The answer is (x − 2)(x − 4). We can check to see if this is correct by multiplying (x − 2)(x − 4):

                                                        x−2
                                                        x−4
                                                     − 4x + 8
                                                x − 2x

                                                x2 − 6x + 8

The answer checks out.

**Example 6**

Factor x2 − 17x + 16.

**Solution:**

We are looking for an answer that is a product of two binomials in parentheses: (x       )(x     )
The number 16 can be written as the product of the following numbers:

           16 = 1 · 16              and          1 + 16 = 17
           16 = (−1) · (−16)        and           − 1 + (−16) = −17      T his is the correct choice.
           16 = 2 · 8               and          2 + 8 = 10
           16 = (−2) · (−8)         and           − 2 + (−8) = −10
           16 = 4 · 4               and          4+4=8
           16 = (−4) · (−4)         and           − 4 + (−4) = −8

The answer is (x − 1)(x − 16).
In general, whenever b is negative and a and c are positive, the two binomial factors will have minus signs
instead of plus signs.


Factor when a = 1 and c is Negative
Now let’s see how this method works if the constant term is negative.

**Example 7**

Factor x2 + 2x − 15.

**Solution:**

We are looking for an answer that is a product of two binomials in parentheses: (x       )(x     )
Once again, we must take the negative sign into account. The number -15 can be written as the product
of the following numbers:

           − 15 = −1 · 15            and             − 1 + 15 = 14
           − 15 = 1 · (−15)          and             1 + (−15) = −14
           − 15 = −3 · 5             and             −3+5=2             T his is the correct choice.
           − 15 = 3 · (−5)           and             3 + (−5) = −2

The answer is (x − 3)(x + 5).
We can check to see if this is correct by multiplying:

                                                         x− 3
                                                         x+ 5
                                                      5x − 15
                                                x − 3x

                                                x2 + 2x − 15
The answer checks out.

**Example 8**

Factor x2 − 10x − 24.

**Solution:**

We are looking for an answer that is a product of two binomials in parentheses: (x       )(x   )
The number -24 can be written as the product of the following numbers:

           − 24 = −1 · 24            and             − 1 + 24 = 23
           − 24 = 1 · (−24)          and             1 + (−24) = −23
           − 24 = −2 · 12            and             − 2 + 12 = 10
           − 24 = 2 · (−12)          and             2 + (−12) = −10    T his is the correct choice.
           − 24 = −3 · 8             and             −3+8=5
           − 24 = 3 · (−8)           and             3 + (−8) = −5
           − 24 = −4 · 6             and             −4+6=2
           − 24 = 4 · (−6)           and             4 + (−6) = −2

The answer is (x − 12)(x + 2).

**Example 9**

Factor x2 + 34x − 35.

**Solution:**

We are looking for an answer that is a product of two binomials in parentheses: (x       )(x   )
The number -35 can be written as the product of the following numbers:

           − 35 = −1 · 35             and              − 1 + 35 = 34    T his is the correct choice.
           − 35 = 1 · (−35)           and             1 + (−35) = −34
           − 35 = −5 · 7              and              −5+7=2
           − 35 = 5 · (−7)            and             5 + (−7) = −2

The answer is (x − 1)(x + 35).

Factor when a = - 1
When a = −1, the best strategy is to factor the common factor of -1 from all the terms in the quadratic
polynomial and then apply the methods you learned so far in this section

**Example 10**

Factor −x2 + x + 6.

**Solution:**

First factor the common factor of -1 from each term in the trinomial. Factoring -1 just changes the signs
of each term in the expression:

                                         −x2 + x + 6 = −(x2 − x − 6)

We’re looking for a product of two binomials in parentheses: −(x       )(x   )
Now our job is to factor x2 − x − 6.
The number -6 can be written as the product of the following numbers:

            − 6 = −1 · 6               and           −1+6=5
            − 6 = 1 · (−6)             and           1 + (−6) = −5
            − 6 = −2 · 3               and           −2+3=1
            − 6 = 2 · (−3)             and           2 + (−3) = −1      T his is the correct choice.

The answer is −(x − 3)(x + 2).


Lesson Summary
- A quadratic of the form x2 +bx+c factors as a product of two binomials in parentheses: (x+m)(x+n)
- If b and c are positive, then both m and n are positive.


Example: x2 + 8x + 12 factors as (x + 6)(x + 2).

- If b is negative and c is positive, then both m and n are negative.

Example: x2 − 6x + 8 factors as (x − 2)(x − 4).

- If c is negative, then either m is positive and n is negative or vice-versa.

Example: x2 + 2x − 15 factors as (x + 5)(x − 3).
Example: x2 + 34x − 35 factors as (x + 35)(x − 1).

- If a = −1, factor out -1 from each term in the trinomial and then factor as usual. The answer will
    have the form: −(x + m)(x + n)

Example: −x2 + x + 6 factors as −(x − 3)(x + 2).

### Learning Objectives

- Factor the diﬀerence of two squares.
- Factor perfect square trinomials.
- Solve quadratic polynomial equation by factoring.


Introduction
When you learned how to multiply binomials we talked about two special products.

                       The sum and diﬀerence formula: (a + b)(a − b) = a2 − b2
                   The square of a binomial formulas:          (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
                                                                (a − b)2 = a2 − 2ab + b2

In this section we’ll learn how to recognize and factor these special products.

Factor the Diﬀerence of Two Squares
We use the sum and diﬀerence formula to factor a diﬀerence of two squares. A diﬀerence of two squares
is any quadratic polynomial in the form a2 − b2 , where a and b can be variables, constants, or just about
anything else. The factors of a2 − b2 are always (a + b)(a − b); the key is ﬁguring out what the a and b
terms are.

**Example 1**

Factor the diﬀerence of squares:
a) x2 − 9
b) x2 − 100
c) x2 − 1

**Solution:**

a) Rewrite x2 − 9 as x2 − 32 . Now it is obvious that it is a diﬀerence of squares.

                              The diﬀerence of squares formula is:           a2 − b2 = (a + b)(a − b)
            Let’s see how our problem matches with the formula:              x2 − 32 = (x + 3)(x − 3)
                                                   The answer is:             x2 − 9 = (x + 3)(x − 3)

We can check to see if this is correct by multiplying (x + 3)(x − 3):

                                                          x+3
                                                          x−3
                                                       − 3x − 9
                                                  x2 + 3x
                                                  x2 + 0x − 9

The answer checks out.
Note: We could factor this polynomial without recognizing it as a diﬀerence of squares. With the methods
we learned in the last section we know that a quadratic polynomial factors into the product of two binomials:

                                                  (x    )(x   )

We need to ﬁnd two numbers that multiply to -9 and add to 0 (since there is no x−term, that’s the same
as if the x−term had a coeﬀicient of 0). We can write -9 as the following products:

             − 9 = −1 · 9            and           −1+9=8
             − 9 = 1 · (−9)          and           1 + (−9) = −8
             − 9 = 3 · (−3)          and           3 + (−3) = 0       T hese are the correct numbers.

We can factor x2 − 9 as (x + 3)(x − 3), which is the same answer as before. You can always factor using
the methods you learned in the previous section, but recognizing special products helps you factor them
faster.
b) Rewrite x2 − 100 as x2 − 102 . This factors as (x + 10)(x − 10).
c) Rewrite x2 − 1 as x2 − 12 . This factors as (x + 1)(x − 1).


**Example 2**

Factor the diﬀerence of squares:
a) 16x2 − 25
b) 4x2 − 81
c) 49x2 − 64

**Solution:**

a) Rewrite 16x2 − 25 as (4x)2 − 52 . This factors as (4x + 5)(4x − 5).
b) Rewrite 4x2 − 81 as (2x)2 − 92 . This factors as (2x + 9)(2x − 9).
c) Rewrite 49x2 − 64 as (7x)2 − 82 . This factors as (7x + 8)(7x − 8).

**Example 3**

Factor the diﬀerence of squares:
a) x2 − y2
b) 9x2 − 4y2
c) x2 y2 − 1

**Solution:**

a) x2 − y2 factors as (x + y)(x − y).
b) Rewrite 9x2 − 4y2 as (3x)2 − (2y)2 . This factors as (3x + 2y)(3x − 2y).
c) Rewrite x2 y2 − 1 as (xy)2 − 12 . This factors as (xy + 1)(xy − 1).

**Example 4**

Factor the diﬀerence of squares:
a) x4 − 25
b) 16x4 − y2
c) x2 y8 − 64z2

**Solution:**

a) Rewrite x4 − 25 as (x2 )2 − 52 . This factors as (x2 + 5)(x2 − 5).
b) Rewrite 16x4 − y2 as (4x2 )2 − y2 . This factors as (4x2 + y)(4x2 − y).
c) Rewrite x2 y4 − 64z2 as (xy2 )2 − (8z)2 . This factors as (xy2 + 8z)(xy2 − 8z).


Factor Perfect Square Trinomials
We use the square of a binomial formula to factor perfect square trinomials. A perfect square trinomial
has the form a2 + 2ab + b2 or a2 − 2ab + b2 .
In these special kinds of trinomials, the ﬁrst and last terms are perfect squares and the middle term is
twice the product of the square roots of the ﬁrst and last terms. In a case like this, the polynomial factors
into perfect squares:

                                            a2 + 2ab + b2 = (a + b)2
                                            a2 − 2ab + b2 = (a − b)2

Once again, the key is ﬁguring out what the a and b terms are.


**Example 5**

Factor the following perfect square trinomials:
a) x2 + 8x + 16
b) x2 − 4x + 4
c) x2 + 14x + 49

**Solution:**

a) The ﬁrst step is to recognize that this expression is a perfect square trinomial.
First, we can see that the ﬁrst term and the last term are perfect squares. We can rewrite x2 + 8x + 16 as
x2 + 8x + 42 .
Next, we check that the middle term is twice the product of the square roots of the ﬁrst and the last terms.
This is true also since we can rewrite x2 + 8x + 16 as x2 + 2 · 4 · x + 42 .
This means we can factor x2 + 8x + 16 as (x + 4)2 . We can check to see if this is correct by multiplying
(x + 4)2 = (x + 4)(x + 4) :

                                                            x+4
                                                             x+4
                                                          4x + 16
                                                    x + 4x
                                                    x2 + 8x + 16

The answer checks out.
Note: We could factor this trinomial without recognizing it as a perfect square. We know that a trinomial
factors as a product of two binomials:

                                                    (x    )(x   )

We need to ﬁnd two numbers that multiply to 16 and add to 8. We can write 16 as the following products:

             16 = 1 · 16             and                 1 + 16 = 17
             16 = 2 · 8              and                 2 + 8 = 10
             16 = 4 · 4              and                 4+4=8         T hese are the correct numbers

So we can factor x2 + 8x + 16 as (x + 4)(x + 4), which is the same as (x + 4)2 .
Once again, you can factor perfect square trinomials the normal way, but recognizing them as perfect
squares gives you a useful shortcut.
b) Rewrite x2 + 4x + 4 as x2 + 2 · (−2) · x + (−2)2 .
We notice that this is a perfect square trinomial, so we can factor it as (x − 2)2 .
c) Rewrite x2 + 14x + 49 as x2 + 2 · 7 · x + 72 .
We notice that this is a perfect square trinomial, so we can factor it as (x + 7)2 .

**Example 6**

Factor the following perfect square trinomials:
a) 4x2 + 20x + 25

b) 9x2 − 24x + 16
c) x2 + 2xy + y2

**Solution:**

a) Rewrite 4x2 + 20x + 25 as (2x)2 + 2 · 5 · (2x) + 52 .
We notice that this is a perfect square trinomial and we can factor it as (2x + 5)2 .
b) Rewrite 9x2 − 24x + 16 as (3x)2 + 2 · (−4) · (3x) + (−4)2 .
We notice that this is a perfect square trinomial and we can factor it as (3x − 4)2 .
We can check to see if this is correct by multiplying (3x − 4)2 = (3x − 4)(3x − 4):

                                                           3x − 4
                                                           3x − 4
                                                       − 12x + 16
                                                9x − 12x

                                                9x2 − 24x + 16

The answer checks out.
c) x2 + 2xy + y2
We notice that this is a perfect square trinomial and we can factor it as (x + y)2 .

Solve Quadratic Polynomial Equations by Factoring
With the methods we’ve learned in the last two sections, we can factor many kinds of quadratic polynomials.
This is very helpful when we want to solve them. Remember the process we learned earlier:

  1. If necessary, rewrite the equation in standard form so that the right-hand side equals zero.
  2. Factor the polynomial completely.
  3. Use the zero-product rule to set each factor equal to zero.
  4. Solve each equation from step 3.
  5. Check your answers by substituting your solutions into the original equation

We can use this process to solve quadratic polynomials using the factoring methods we just learned.

**Example 7**

Solve the following polynomial equations.
a) x2 + 7x + 6 = 0
b) x2 − 8x = −12
c) x2 = 2x + 15

**Solution:**

a) Rewrite: We can skip this since the equation is in the correct form already.
Factor: We can write 6 as a product of the following numbers:

              6=1·6                 and              1+6=7            T his is the correct choice.
              6=2·3                 and              2+3=5

x2 + 7x + 6 = 0 factors as (x + 1)(x + 6) = 0.
Set each factor equal to zero:

                        x+1=0                       or                         x+6=0

Solve:

                        x = −1                      or                          x = −6

Check: Substitute each solution back into the original equation.

             x = −6               (−6) + 7(−6) + 6 = 36 − 42 + 6 = 0
                                                                                       checks out

b) Rewrite: x2 − 8x = −12 is rewritten as x2 − 8x + 12 = 0

          12 = −1 · (−12)           and           − 1 + (−12) = −13
          12 = 2 · 6                and           2+6=8

          12 = 3 · 4                and           3+4=7
          12 = −3 · (−4)            and           − 3 + (−4) = −7

x2 + 8x + 12 = 0 factors as (x − 2)(x − 6) = 0.
Set each factor equal to zero:

                        x−2=0                       or                         x−6=0

                                                                                    checks out

c) Rewrite: x2 = 2x + 15 is rewritten as x2 − 2x − 15 = 0
Factor: We can write -15 as a product of the following numbers:

           − 15 = 1 · (−15)           and            1 + (−15) = −14
           − 15 = −1 · (15)           and            − 1 + (15) = 14
           − 15 = −3 · 5              and            −3+5=2
           − 15 = 3 · (−5)            and            3 + (−5) = −2      T his is the correct choice.

x2 − 2x − 15 = 0 factors as (x + 3)(x − 5) = 0
Set each factor equal to zero:

                        x+3=0                        or                       x−5=0

Solve:

                          x = −3                      or                        x=5

                 x = −3               (−3)2 = 2(−3) + 15 ⇒ 9 = 9                   checks out
                 x=5                  (5)2 = 2(5) + 15 ⇒ 25 = 25                   checks out

We recognize this as a perfect square. This factors as (x − 6)2 = 0 or (x − 6)(x − 6) = 0
Set each factor equal to zero:

                        x−6=0                        or                       x−6=0

Check: Substitute each solution back into the original equation.

                x=9                     92 − 81 = 81 − 81 = 0                      checks out
                x = −9                  (−9) − 81 = 81 − 81 = 0

Check: Substitute each solution back into the original equation.

           x = 10           (−10)2 + 20(−10) + 100 = 100 − 200 + 100 = 0                checks out

## 9.7 Factoring Polynomials Completely


### Learning Objectives

- Factor out a common binomial.
- Factor by grouping.
- Factor a quadratic trinomial where a , 1.
- Solve real world problems using polynomial equations.


Introduction
We say that a polynomial is factored completely when we can’t factor it any more. Here are some
suggestions that you should follow to make sure that you factor completely:

- Factor all common monomials ﬁrst.
- Identify special products such as diﬀerence of squares or the square of a binomial. Factor according
    to their formulas.
- If there are no special products, factor using the methods we learned in the previous sections.
- Look at each factor and see if any of these can be factored further.


**Example 1**

Factor the following polynomials completely.
a) 6x2 − 30x + 24
b) 2x2 − 8
c) x3 + 6x2 + 9x


**Solution:**

a) Factor out the common monomial. In this case 6 can be divided from each term:

                                               6(x2 − 5x − 6)

There are no special products. We factor x2 − 5x + 6 as a product of two binomials: (x )(x )
The two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5 are -2 and -3, so:

                                      6(x2 − 5x + 6) = 6(x − 2)(x − 3)

If we look at each factor we see that we can factor no more.
The answer is 6(x − 2)(x − 3).
b) Factor out common monomials: 2x2 − 8 = 2(x2 − 4)
We recognize x2 − 4 as a diﬀerence of squares. We factor it as (x + 2)(x − 2).
If we look at each factor we see that we can factor no more.
The answer is 2(x + 2)(x − 2).
c) Factor out common monomials: x3 + 6x2 + 9x = x(x2 + 6x + 9)
We recognize x2 + 6x + 9 as a perfect square and factor it as (x + 3)2 .
If we look at each factor we see that we can factor no more.
The answer is x(x + 3)2 .

**Example 2**

Factor the following polynomials completely:
a) −2x4 + 162
b) x5 − 8x3 + 16x

**Solution:**

a) Factor out the common monomial. In this case, factor out -2 rather than 2. (It’s always easier to factor
out the negative number so that the highest degree term is positive.)

                                          −2x4 + 162 = −2(x4 − 81)

We recognize expression in parenthesis as a diﬀerence of squares. We factor and get:

                                             −2(x2 − 9)(x2 + 9)

If we look at each factor we see that the ﬁrst parenthesis is a diﬀerence of squares. We factor and get:

                                          −2(x + 3)(x − 3)(x2 + 9)

If we look at each factor now we see that we can factor no more.
The answer is −2(x + 3)(x − 3)(x2 + 9).
b) Factor out the common monomial: x5 − 8x3 + 14x = x(x4 − 8x2 + 16)
We recognize x4 − 8x2 + 16 as a perfect square and we factor it as x(x2 − 4)2 .

We look at each term and recognize that the term in parentheses is a diﬀerence of squares.
We factor it and get ((x + 2)(x − 2))2 , which we can rewrite as (x + 2)2 (x − 2)2 .
If we look at each factor now we see that we can factor no more.
The ﬁnal answer is x(x + 2)2 (x − 2)2 .


Factor out a Common Binomial
The ﬁrst step in the factoring process is often factoring out the common monomials from a polynomial.
But sometimes polynomials have common terms that are binomials. For example, consider the following
expression:

                                             x(3x + 2) − 5(3x + 2)

Since the term (3x + 2) appears in both terms of the polynomial, we can factor it out. We write that term
in front of a set of parentheses containing the terms that are left over:

                                                (3x + 2)(x − 5)

This expression is now completely factored.
Let’s look at some more examples.

**Example 3**

Factor out the common binomials.
a) 3x(x − 1) + 4(x − 1)
b) x(4x + 5) + (4x + 5)

**Solution:**

a) 3x(x − 1) + 4(x − 1) has a common binomial of (x − 1).
When we factor out the common binomial we get (x − 1)(3x + 4).
b) x(4x + 5) + (4x + 5) has a common binomial of (4x + 5).
When we factor out the common binomial we get (4x + 5)(x + 1).


Factor by Grouping
Sometimes, we can factor a polynomial containing four or more terms by factoring common monomials
from groups of terms. This method is called factor by grouping.
The next example illustrates how this process works.

**Example 4**

Factor 2x + 2y + ax + ay.

**Solution:**

There is no factor common to all the terms. However, the ﬁrst two terms have a common factor of 2 and
the last two terms have a common factor of a. Factor 2 from the ﬁrst two terms and factor a from the last
two terms:

                                   2x + 2y + ax + ay = 2(x + y) + a(x + y)

Now we notice that the binomial (x + y) is common to both terms. We factor the common binomial and
get:

                                               (x + y)(2 + a)


**Example 5**

Factor 3x2 + 6x + 4x + 8.

**Solution:**

We factor 3 from the ﬁrst two terms and factor 4 from the last two terms:

                                            3x(x + 2) + 4(x + 2)

Now factor (x + 2) from both terms: (x + 2)(3x + 4).
Now the polynomial is factored completely.


Factor Quadratic Trinomials Where a � 1
Factoring by grouping is a very useful method for factoring quadratic trinomials of the form ax2 + bx + c,
where a , 1.
A quadratic like this doesn’t factor as (x ± m)(x ± n), so it’s not as simple as looking for two numbers that
multiply to c and add up to b. Instead, we also have to take into account the coeﬀicient in the ﬁrst term.
To factor a quadratic polynomial where a , 1, we follow these steps:

  1. We ﬁnd the product ac.
  2. We look for two numbers that multiply to ac and add up to b.
  3. We rewrite the middle term using the two numbers we just found.
  4. We factor the expression by grouping.

Let’s apply this method to the following examples.

**Example 6**

Factor the following quadratic trinomials by grouping.
a) 3x2 + 8x + 4
b) 6x2 − 11x + 4
c) 5x2 − 6x + 1

**Solution:**

Let’s follow the steps outlined above:
a) 3x2 + 8x + 4
Step 1: ac = 3 · 4 = 12
Step 2: The number 12 can be written as a product of two numbers in any of these ways:

             12 = 1 · 12             and               1 + 12 = 13
             12 = 2 · 6              and               2+6=8         T his is the correct choice.
             12 = 3 · 4              and               3+4=7

Step 3: Re-write the middle term: 8x = 2x + 6x, so the problem becomes:

                                     3x2 + 8x + 4 = 3x2 + 2x + 6x + 4

Step 4: Factor an x from the ﬁrst two terms and a 2 from the last two terms:

                                           x(3x + 2) + 2(3x + 2)

Now factor the common binomial (3x + 2):

                                   (3x + 2)(x + 2)       T his is the answer.

To check if this is correct we multiply (3x + 2)(x + 2):

                                                        3x + 2
                                                         x+2
                                                        6x + 4
                                                3x + 2x
                                                3x2 + 8x + 4

The solution checks out.
b) 6x2 − 11x + 4
Step 1: ac = 6 · 4 = 24
Step 2: The number 24 can be written as a product of two numbers in any of these ways:

          24 = 1 · 24               and           1 + 24 = 25
          24 = −1 · (−24)           and              − 1 + (−24) = −25
          24 = 2 · 12               and           2 + 12 = 14
          24 = −2 · (−12)           and              − 2 + (−12) = −14
          24 = 3 · 8                and           3 + 8 = 11
          24 = −3 · (−8)            and              − 3 + (−8) = −11      T his is the correct choice.
          24 = 4 · 6                and           4 + 6 = 10
          24 = −4 · (−6)            and              − 4 + (−6) = −10

Step 3: Re-write the middle term: −11x = −3x − 8x, so the problem becomes:

                                     6x2 − 11x + 4 = 6x2 − 3x − 8x + 4

Step 4: Factor by grouping: factor a 3x from the ﬁrst two terms and a -4 from the last two terms:

                                           3x(2x − 1) − 4(2x − 1)

Now factor the common binomial (2x − 1):

                                  (2x − 1)(3x − 4)       T his is the answer.

c) 5x2 − 6x + 1

Step 1: ac = 5 · 1 = 5
Step 2: The number 5 can be written as a product of two numbers in any of these ways:

           5=1·5                    and               1+5=6
           5 = −1 · (−5)            and               − 1 + (−5) = −6      T his is the correct choice.

Step 3: Re-write the middle term: −6x = −x − 5x, so the problem becomes:

                                       5x2 − 6x + 1 = 5x2 − x − 5x + 1

Step 4: Factor by grouping: factor an x from the ﬁrst two terms and a − 1 from the last two terms:

                                             x(5x − 1) − 1(5x − 1)

Now factor the common binomial (5x − 1):

                                    (5x − 1)(x − 1)      T his is the answer.


Solve Real-World Problems Using Polynomial Equations
Now that we know most of the factoring strategies for quadratic polynomials, we can apply these methods
to solving real world problems.

**Example 7**

One leg of a right triangle is 3 feet longer than the other leg. The hypotenuse is 15 feet. Find the dimensions
of the triangle.

**Solution:**

Let x = the length of the short leg of the triangle; then the other leg will measure x + 3.


Use the Pythagorean Theorem: a2 + b2 = c2 , where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length
of the hypotenuse. When we substitute the values from the diagram, we get x2 + (x + 3)2 = 152 .
In order to solve this equation, we need to get the polynomial in standard form. We must ﬁrst distribute,
collect like terms and rewrite in the form “polynomial = 0.”

                                           x2 + x2 + 6x + 9 = 225
                                               2x2 + 6x + 9 = 225
                                             2x2 + 6x − 216 = 0

Factor out the common monomial: 2(x2 + 3x − 108) = 0
To factor the trinomial inside the parentheses, we need two numbers that multiply to -108 and add to 3.
It would take a long time to go through all the options, so let’s start by trying some of the bigger factors:

           −108 = −12 · 9             and              − 12 + 9 = −3
           −108 = 12 · (−9)           and             12 + (−9) = 3     T his is the correct choice.

We factor the expression as 2(x − 9)(x + 12) = 0.
Set each term equal to zero and solve:

                     x−9=0                                                   x + 12 = 0
                                                     or
                     x=9                                                     x = −12

It makes no sense to have a negative answer for the length of a side of the triangle, so the answer must be
x = 9. That means the short leg is 9 feet and the long leg is 12 feet.
Check: 92 + 122 = 81 + 144 = 225 = 152 , so the answer checks.

**Example 8**

The product of two positive numbers is 60. Find the two numbers if one numbers is 4 more than the other.

**Solution:**

Let x = one of the numbers; then x + 4 is the other number.
The product of these two numbers is 60, so we can write the equation x(x + 4) = 60.
In order to solve we must write the polynomial in standard form. Distribute, collect like terms and rewrite:

                                                    x2 + 4x = 60
                                             x2 + 4x − 60 = 0

Factor by ﬁnding two numbers that multiply to -60 and add to 4. List some numbers that multiply to
-60:

           −60 = −4 · 15              and              − 4 + 15 = 11
           −60 = 4 · (−15)            and             4 + (−15) = −11
           −60 = −5 · 12              and              − 5 + 12 = 7
           −60 = 5 · (−12)            and             5 + (−12) = −7
           −60 = −6 · 10              and              − 6 + 10 = 4     T his is the correct choice.
           −60 = 6 · (−10)            and             6 + (−10) = −4

The expression factors as (x + 10)(x − 6) = 0.
Set each term equal to zero and solve:

                     x + 10 = 0                                                x−6=0
                                                       or
                     x = −10                                                   x=6

Since we are looking for positive numbers, the answer must be x = 6. One number is 6, and the other
number is 10.

Check: 6 · 10 = 60, so the answer checks.

**Example 9**

A rectangle has sides of length x + 5 and x − 3. What is x if the area of the rectangle is 48?

**Solution:**

Make a sketch of this situation:


Using the formula Area = length × width, we have (x + 5)(x − 3) = 48.
In order to solve, we must write the polynomial in standard form. Distribute, collect like terms and
rewrite:

                                                x2 + 2x − 15 = 48
                                                x2 + 2x − 63 = 0

Factor by ﬁnding two numbers that multiply to -63 and add to 2. List some numbers that multiply to
-63:

           −63 = −7 · 9               and               −7+9=2          T his is the correct choice.
           −63 = 7 · (−9)             and               7 + (−9) = −2

The expression factors as (x + 9)(x − 7) = 0.
Set each term equal to zero and solve:

                      x+9=0                                                    x−7=0
                                                       or
                      x = −9                                                   x=7

Since we are looking for positive numbers the answer must be x = 7. So the width is x − 3 = 4 and the
length is x + 5 = 12.
Check: 4 · 12 = 48, so the answer checks.

# Chapter 10: Quadratic Equations and Quadratic Functions


## 10.1 Graphs of Quadratic Functions


### Learning Objectives

- Graph quadratic functions.
- Compare graphs of quadratic functions.
- Graph quadratic functions in intercept form.
- Analyze graphs of real-world quadratic functions.


Introduction
The graphs of quadratic functions are curved lines called parabolas. You don’t have to look hard to ﬁnd
parabolic shapes around you. Here are a few examples:

- The path that a ball or a rocket takes through the air.
- Water ﬂowing out of a drinking fountain.
- The shape of a satellite dish.
- The shape of the mirror in car headlights or a ﬂashlight.
- The cables in a suspension bridge.


Graph Quadratic Functions
Let’s see what a parabola looks like by graphing the simplest quadratic function, y = x2 .
We’ll graph this function by making a table of values. Since the graph will be curved, we need to plot a
fair number of points to make it accurate.

                                                Table 10.1:

 x                                                     y = x2
 −3                                                    (−3)2 = 9

                                        Table 10.1: (continued)

 x                                                   y = x2
 –2                                                  (−2)2 = 4
 –1                                                  (−1)2 = 1
 0                                                   (0)2 = 0
 1                                                   (1)2 = 1
 2                                                   (2)2 = 4
 3                                                   (3)2 = 9


Here are the points plotted on a coordinate graph:


To draw the parabola, draw a smooth curve through all the points. (Do not connect the points with
straight lines).


Let’s graph a few more examples.

**Example 1**

Graph the following parabolas.
a) y = 2x2 + 4x + 1
b) y = −x2 + 3
c) y = x2 − 8x + 3

**Solution:**

a) y = 2x2 + 4x + 1
Make a table of values:

                                              Table 10.2:

 x                                                    y = 2x2 + 4x + 1
 −3                                                   2(−3)2 + 4(−3) + 1 = 7
 –2                                                   2(−2)2 + 4(−2) + 1 = 1
 –1                                                   2(−1)2 + 4(−1) + 1 = −1
 0                                                    2(0)2 + 4(0) + 1 = 1
 1                                                    2(1)2 + 4(1) + 1 = 7
 2                                                    2(2)2 + 4(2) + 1 = 17
 3                                                    2(3)2 + 4(3) + 1 = 31


Notice that the last two points have very large y−values. Since we don’t want to make our y−scale too big,
we’ll just skip graphing those two points. But we’ll plot the remaining points and join them with a smooth
curve.


b) y = −x2 + 3
Make a table of values:
                                              Table 10.3:

 x                                                    y = −x2 + 3
 −3                                                   −(−3)2 + 3 = −6
 –2                                                   −(−2)2 + 3 = −1
 –1                                                   −(−1)2 + 3 = 2
 0                                                    −(0)2 + 3 = 3
 1                                                    −(1)2 + 3 = 2
 2                                                    −(2)2 + 3 = −1
 3                                                    −(3)2 + 3 = −6


Plot the points and join them with a smooth curve.

Notice that this time we get an “upside down” parabola. That’s because our equation has a negative sign
in front of the x2 term. The sign of the coeﬀicient of the x2 term determines whether the parabola turns
up or down: the parabola turns up if it’s positive and down if it’s negative.
c) y = x2 − 8x + 3
Make a table of values:
                                               Table 10.4:

 x                                                     y = x2 − 8x + 3
 −3                                                    (−3)2 − 8(−3) + 3 = 36
 –2                                                    (−2)2 − 8(−2) + 3 = 23
 –1                                                    (−1)2 − 8(−1) + 3 = 12
 0                                                     (0)2 − 8(0) + 3 = 3
 1                                                     (1)2 − 8(1) + 3 = −4
 2                                                     (2)2 − 8(2) + 3 = −9
 3                                                     (3)2 − 8(3) + 3 = −12


Let’s not graph the ﬁrst two points in the table since the values are so big. Plot the remaining points and
join them with a smooth curve.


Wait—this doesn’t look like a parabola. What’s going on here?
Maybe if we graph more points, the curve will look more familiar. For negative values of x it looks like the
values of y are just getting bigger and bigger, so let’s pick more positive values of x beyond x = 3.


                                               Table 10.5:

 x                                                    y = x2 − 8x + 3
 −1                                                   (−1)2 − 8(−1) + 3 = 12
 0                                                    (0)2 − 8(0) + 3 = 3
 1                                                    (1)2 − 8(1) + 3 = −4
 2                                                    (2)2 − 8(2) + 3 = −9
 3                                                    (3)2 − 8(3) + 3 = −12
 4                                                    (4)2 − 8(4) + 3 = −13
 5                                                    (5)2 − 8(5) + 3 = −12
 6                                                    (6)2 − 8(6) + 3 = −9
 7                                                    (7)2 − 8(7) + 3 = −4
 8                                                    (8)2 − 8(8) + 3 = 3


Plot the points again and join them with a smooth curve.


Now we can see the familiar parabolic shape. And now we can see the drawback to graphing quadratics
by making a table of values—if we don’t pick the right values, we won’t get to see the important parts of
the graph.
In the next couple of lessons, we’ll ﬁnd out how to graph quadratic equations more eﬀiciently—but ﬁrst
we need to learn more about the properties of parabolas.


Compare Graphs of Quadratic Functions
The general form (or standard form) of a quadratic function is:

                                             y = ax2 + bx + c

Here a, b and c are the coeﬀicients. Remember, a coeﬀicient is just a number (a constant term) that can
go before a variable or appear alone.
Although the graph of a quadratic equation in standard form is always a parabola, the shape of the parabola
depends on the values of the coeﬀicients a, b and c. Let’s explore some of the ways the coeﬀicients can
aﬀect the graph.
Dilation
Changing the value of a makes the graph “fatter” or “skinnier”. Let’s look at how graphs compare for

diﬀerent positive values of a. The plot on the left shows the graphs of y = x2 and y = 3x2 . The plot on
the right shows the graphs of y = x2 and y = 31 x2 .


Notice that the larger the value of a is, the skinnier the graph is – for example, in the ﬁrst plot, the graph of
y = 3x2 is skinnier than the graph of y = x2 . Also, the smaller a is, the fatter the graph is – for example, in
the second plot, the graph of y = 31 x2 is fatter than the graph of y = x2 . This might seem counterintuitive,
but if you think about it, it should make sense. Let’s look at a table of values of these graphs and see if
we can explain why this happens.

                                                 Table 10.6:

 x                           y = x2                      y = 3x2                      y = 13 x2
                                                                                      (−3)2

                                                                                      (3) 2

From the table, you can see that the values of y = 3x2 are bigger than the values of y = x2 . This is because
each value of y gets multiplied by 3. As a result the parabola will be skinnier because it grows three times
faster than y = x2 . On the other hand, you can see that the values of y = 13 x2 are smaller than the values
of y = x2 , because each value of y gets divided by 3. As a result the parabola will be fatter because it
grows at one third the rate of y = x2 .
Orientation
As the value of a gets smaller and smaller, then, the parabola gets wider and ﬂatter. What happens when
a gets all the way down to zero? What happens when it’s negative?
Well, when a = 0, the x2 term drops out of the equation entirely, so the equation becomes linear and the
graph is just a straight line. For example, we just saw what happens to y = ax2 when we change the value
of a; if we tried to graph y = 0x2 , we would just be graphing y = 0, which would be a horizontal line.
So as a gets smaller and smaller, the graph of y = ax2 gets ﬂattened all the way out into a horizontal
line. Then, when a becomes negative, the graph of y = ax2 starts to curve again, only it curves downward
instead of upward. This ﬁts with what you’ve already learned: the graph opens upward if a is positive and
downward if a is negative.

For example, here are the graphs of y = x2 and y = −x2 . You can see that the parabola has the same shape
in both graphs, but the graph of y = x2 is right-side-up and the graph of y = −x2 is upside-down.


Vertical Shift
Changing the constant c just shifts the parabola up or down. The following plot shows the graphs of
y = x2 , y = x2 + 1, y = x2 − 1, y = x2 + 2, and y = x2 − 2.


You can see that when c is positive, the graph shifts up, and when c is negative the graph shifts down; in
either case, it shifts by |c| units. In one of the later sections we’ll learn about horizontal shift (i.e. moving
to the right or to the left). Before we can do that, though, we need to learn how to rewrite quadratic
equations in diﬀerent forms.
Meanwhile, if you want to explore further what happens when you change the coeﬀicients of a quadratic
equation, the page at http://www.analyzemath.com/quadraticg/quadraticg.htm has an applet you can
use. Click on the “Click here to start” button in section A, and then use the sliders to change the values
of a, b, and c.


Graph Quadratic Functions in Intercept Form

Now it’s time to learn how to graph a parabola without having to use a table with a large number of
points.
Let’s look at the graph of y = x2 − 6x + 8.

There are several things we can notice:

- The parabola crosses the x−axis at two points: x = 2 and x = 4. These points are called the x−
    intercepts of the parabola.
- The lowest point of the parabola occurs at (3, -1).
        – This point is called the vertex of the parabola.
        – The vertex is the lowest point in any parabola that turns upward, or the highest point in any
          parabola that turns downward.
        – The vertex is exactly halfway between the two x−intercepts. This will always be the case,
          and you can ﬁnd the vertex using that property.
- The parabola is symmetric. If you draw a vertical line through the vertex, you see that the two
    halves of the parabola are mirror images of each other. This vertical line is called the line of
    symmetry.

We said that the general form of a quadratic function is y = ax2 + bx + c. When we can factor a quadratic
expression, we can rewrite the function in intercept form:

                                           y = a(x − m)(x − n)

This form is very useful because it makes it easy for us to ﬁnd the x−intercepts and the vertex of the
parabola. The x−intercepts are the values of x where the graph crosses the x−axis; in other words, they
are the values of x when y = 0. To ﬁnd the x−intercepts from the quadratic function, we set y = 0 and
solve:

                                           0 = a(x − m)(x − n)

Since the equation is already factored, we use the zero-product property to set each factor equal to zero
and solve the individual linear equations:

                     x−m=0                                                 x−n=0
                                                   or
                         x=m                                                  x=n

So the x−intercepts are at points (m, 0) and (n, 0).
Once we ﬁnd the x−intercepts, it’s simple to ﬁnd the vertex. The x−value of the vertex is halfway between
the two x−intercepts, so we can ﬁnd it by taking the average of the two values: m+n
                                                                                 2 . Then we can ﬁnd the
y−value by plugging the value of x back into the equation of the function.

**Example 2**

Find the x−intercepts and the vertex of the following quadratic functions:
a) y = x2 − 8x + 15
b) y = 3x2 + 6x − 24

**Solution:**

a) y = x2 − 8x + 15
Write the quadratic function in intercept form by factoring the right hand side of the equation. Remember,
to factor we need two numbers whose product is 15 and whose sum is –8. These numbers are –5 and –3.
The function in intercept form is y = (x − 5)(x − 3)
We ﬁnd the x−intercepts by setting y = 0.
We have:

                      0 = (x − 5)(x − 3)
                      x−5=0                                                   x−3=0
                                                             or
                      x=5                                                     x=3

So the x−intercepts are (5, 0) and (3, 0).
The vertex is halfway between the two x−intercepts. We ﬁnd the x−value by taking the average of the two
x−intercepts: x = 5+3
                   2 =4
We ﬁnd the y−value by plugging the x−value we just found into the original equation:

                          y = x2 − 8x + 15 ⇒ y = 42 − 8(4) + 15 = 16 − 32 + 15 = −1

So the vertex is (4, -1).
b) y = 3x2 + 6x − 24
Re-write the function in intercept form.
Factor the common term of 3 ﬁrst: y = 3(x2 + 2x − 8)
Then factor completely: y = 3(x + 4)(x − 2)
Set y = 0 and solve:

                                                       x+4=0                          x−2=0
              0 = 3(x + 4)(x − 2) ⇒                                or
                                                       x = −4                         x=2

The x−intercepts are (-4, 0) and (2, 0).
For the vertex,
x = −4+2
      2  = −1 and y = 3(−1)2 + 6(−1) − 24 = 3 − 6 − 24 = −27

The vertex is: (-1, -27)
Knowing the vertex and x−intercepts is a useful ﬁrst step toward being able to graph quadratic functions
more easily. Knowing the vertex tells us where the middle of the parabola is. When making a table of
values, we can make sure to pick the vertex as a point in the table. Then we choose just a few smaller and
larger values of x. In this way, we get an accurate graph of the quadratic function without having to have
too many points in our table.

**Example 3**

Find the x−intercepts and vertex. Use these points to create a table of values and graph each function.
a) y = x2 − 4
b) y = −x2 + 14x − 48

**Solution:**

a) y = x2 − 4
Let’s ﬁnd the x−intercepts and the vertex:
Factor the right-hand side of the function to put the equation in intercept form:

                                             y = (x − 2)(x + 2)

Set y = 0 and solve:

                    0 = (x − 2)(x + 2)
                    x−2=0                                                       x+2=0
                                                           or
                    x=2                                                         x = −2

The x−intercepts are (2, 0) and (-2, 0).
Find the vertex:
                                           2−2
                                     x=        =0      y = (0)2 − 4 = −4

The vertex is (0, -4).
Make a table of values using the vertex as the middle point. Pick a few values of x smaller and larger than
x = 0. Include the x−intercepts in the table.

                                                  Table 10.7:

 x                                   y = x2 − 4
 −3                                  y = (−3)2 − 4 = 5
 –2                                  y = (−2)2 − 4 = 0                     x−intercept
 –1                                  y = (−1)2 − 4 = −3
 0                                   y = (0)2 − 4 = −4                     vertex
 1                                   y = (1)2 − 4 = −3
 2                                   y = (2)2 − 4 = 0                      x−intercept
 3                                   y = (3)2 − 4 = 5


Then plot the graph:


b) y = −x2 + 14x − 48
Let’s ﬁnd the x−intercepts and the vertex:
Factor the right-hand-side of the function to put the equation in intercept form:

                                  y = −(x2 − 14x + 48) = −(x − 6)(x − 8)

Set y = 0 and solve:

                   0 = −(x − 6)(x − 8)
                    x−6=0                                                     x−8=0
                                                         or
                    x=6                                                       x=8

The x−intercepts are (6, 0) and (8, 0).
Find the vertex:
                                     6+8
                                x=       = 7 y = −(7)2 + 14(7) − 48 = 1

The vertex is (7, 1).
Make a table of values using the vertex as the middle point. Pick a few values of x smaller and larger than
x = 7. Include the x−intercepts in the table.

                                               Table 10.8:

 x                                                    y = −x2 + 14x − 48
 4                                                    y = −(4)2 + 14(4) − 48 = −8

Analyze Graphs of Real-World Quadratic Functions.


As we mentioned at the beginning of this section, parabolic curves are common in real-world applications.
Here we will look at a few graphs that represent some examples of real-life application of quadratic functions.

**Example 4**

Andrew has 100 feet of fence to enclose a rectangular tomato patch. What should the dimensions of the
rectangle be in order for the rectangle to have the greatest possible area?

**Solution:**

Drawing a picture will help us ﬁnd an equation to describe this situation:


If the length of the rectangle is x, then the width is 50 − x. (The length and the width add up to 50, not
100, because two lengths and two widths together add up to 100.)
If we let y be the area of the triangle, then we know that the area is length × width, so y = x(50−x) = 50x−x2 .
Here’s the graph of that function, so we can see how the area of the rectangle depends on the length of the
rectangle:

We can see from the graph that the highest value of the area occurs when the length of the rectangle is 25.
The area of the rectangle for this side length equals 625. (Notice that the width is also 25, which makes
the shape a square with side length 25.)
This is an example of an optimization problem. These problems show up often in the real world, and if
you ever study calculus, you’ll learn how to solve them without graphs.

**Example 5**

Anne is playing golf. On the 4th tee, she hits a slow shot down the level fairway. The ball follows a parabolic
path described by the equation y = x − 0.04x2 , where y is the ball’s height in the air and x is the horizontal
distance it has traveled from the tee. The distances are measured in feet. How far from the tee does the
ball hit the ground? At what distance from the tee does the ball attain its maximum height? What is the
maximum height?

**Solution:**

Let’s graph the equation of the path of the ball:


x(1 − 0.04x) = 0 has solutions x = 0 and x = 25.
From the graph, we see that the ball hits the ground 25 feet from the tee. (The other x−intercept,
x = 0, tells us that the ball was also on the ground when it was on the tee!)
We can also see that the ball reaches its maximum height of about 6.25 feet when it is 12.5 feet from
the tee.

## 10.2 Quadratic Equations by Graphing


### Learning Objectives


- Identify the number of solutions of a quadratic equation.
- Solve quadratic equations by graphing.
- Analyze quadratic functions using a graphing calculator.
- Solve real-world problems by graphing quadratic functions.


Introduction

Solving a quadratic equation means ﬁnding the x−values that will make the quadratic function equal zero;
in other words, it means ﬁnding the points where the graph of the function crosses the x−axis. The solutions
to a quadratic equation are also called the roots or zeros of the function, and in this section we’ll learn
how to ﬁnd them by graphing the function.


Identify the Number of Solutions of a Quadratic Equation

Three diﬀerent situations can occur when graphing a quadratic function:
Case 1: The parabola crosses the x−axis at two points. An example of this is y = x2 + x − 6:


Looking at the graph, we see that the parabola crosses the x−axis at x = −3 and x = 2.
We can also ﬁnd the solutions to the equation x2 + x − 6 = 0 by setting y = 0. We solve the equation by
factoring:
(x + 3)(x − 2) = 0, so x = −3 or x = 2.
When the graph of a quadratic function crosses the x−axis at two points, we get two distinct solutions
to the quadratic equation.
Case 2: The parabola touches the x−axis at one point. An example of this is y = x2 − 2x + 1:

We can see that the graph touches the x−axis at x = 1.
We can also solve this equation by factoring. If we set y = 0 and factor, we obtain (x − 1)2 = 0, so x = 1.
Since the quadratic function is a perfect square, we get only one solution for the equation—it’s just the
same solution repeated twice over.
When the graph of a quadratic function touches the x−axis at one point, the quadratic equation has one
solution and the solution is called a double root.
Case 3: The parabola does not cross or touch the x−axis. An example of this is y = x2 + 4:


If we set y = 0 we get x2 + 4 = 0. This quadratic polynomial does not factor.
When the graph of a quadratic function does not cross or touch the x−axis, the quadratic equation has no
real solutions.


Solve Quadratic Equations by Graphing
So far we’ve found the solutions to quadratic equations using factoring. However, in real life very few
functions factor easily. As you just saw, graphing a function gives a lot of information about the solutions.
We can ﬁnd exact or approximate solutions to a quadratic equation by graphing the function associated
with it.

**Example 1**

Find the solutions to the following quadratic equations by graphing.
a) −x2 + 3 = 0

b) 2x2 + 5x − 7 = 0
c) −x2 + x − 3 = 0
d) y = −x2 + 4x − 4

**Solution:**

Since we can’t factor any of these equations, we won’t be able to graph them using intercept form (if
we could, we wouldn’t need to use the graphs to ﬁnd the intercepts!) We’ll just have to make a table of
arbitrary values to graph each one.
a)

                                             Table 10.9:

 x                                                   y = −x2 + 3
 −3                                                  y = −(−3)2 + 3 = −6
 –2                                                  y = −(−2)2 + 3 = −1
 –1                                                  y = −(−1)2 + 3 = 2
 0                                                   y = −(0)2 + 3 = 3
 1                                                   y = −(1)2 + 3 = 2
 2                                                   y = −(2)2 + 3 = −1
 3                                                   y = −(3)2 + 3 = −6


We plot the points and get the following graph:


From the graph we can read that the x−intercepts are approximately x = 1.7 and x = −1.7. These are the
solutions to the equation.

 1                                                   y = 2(1)2 + 5(1) − 7 = 0

We plot the points and get the following graph:


From the graph we can read that the x−intercepts are x = 1 and x = −3.5. These are the solutions to the
equation.

 –2                                                  y = −(−2)2 + (−2) − 3 = −9
 –1                                                  y = −(−1)2 + (−1) − 3 = −5

We plot the points and get the following graph:

The graph curves up toward the x−axis and then back down without ever reaching it. This means that
the graph never intercepts the x−axis, and so the corresponding equation has no real solutions.

 −3                                                 y = −(−3)2 + 4(−3) − 4 = −25

Here is the graph of this function:


The graph just touches the x−axis at x = 2, so the function has a double root there. x = 2 is the only
solution to the equation.

Analyze Quadratic Functions Using a Graphing Calculator

A graphing calculator is very useful for graphing quadratic functions. Once the function is graphed, we
can use the calculator to ﬁnd important information such as the roots or the vertex of the function.

**Example 2**

Use a graphing calculator to analyze the graph of y = x2 − 20x + 35.

**Solution:**

1. Graph the function.
Press the [Y=] button and enter “x2 − 20x + 35” next to [Y1 =]. Press the [GRAPH] button. This is the
plot you should see:


If this is not what you see, press the [WINDOW] button to change the window size. For the graph shown
here, the x−values should range from -10 to 30 and the y−values from -80 to 50.
2. Find the roots.
There are at least three ways to ﬁnd the roots:
Use [TRACE] to scroll over the x−intercepts. The approximate value of the roots will be shown on the
screen. You can improve your estimate by zooming in.
OR
Use [TABLE] and scroll through the values until you ﬁnd values of y equal to zero. You can change the
accuracy of the solution by setting the step size with the [TBLSET] function.
OR
Use [2nd] [TRACE] (i.e. ‘calc’ button) and use option ‘zero’.
Move the cursor to the left of one of the roots and press [ENTER].
Move the cursor to the right of the same root and press [ENTER].
Move the cursor close to the root and press [ENTER].
The screen will show the value of the root. Repeat the procedure for the other root.
Whichever technique you use, you should get about x = 1.9 and x = 18 for the two roots.
3. Find the vertex.
There are three ways to ﬁnd the vertex:
Use [TRACE] to scroll over the highest or lowest point on the graph. The approximate value of the roots

will be shown on the screen.
OR
Use [TABLE] and scroll through the values until you ﬁnd values the lowest or highest value of y. You can
change the accuracy of the solution by setting the step size with the [TBLSET] function.
OR
Use [2nd] [TRACE] and use the option ‘maximum’ if the vertex is a maximum or ‘minimum’ if the vertex
is a minimum.
Move the cursor to the left of the vertex and press [ENTER].
Move the cursor to the right of the vertex and press [ENTER].
Move the cursor close to the vertex and press [ENTER].
The screen will show the x− and y−values of the vertex.
Whichever method you use, you should ﬁnd that the vertex is at (10, -65).


Solve Real-World Problems by Graphing Quadratic Functions
Here’s a real-world problem we can solve using the graphing methods we’ve learned.

**Example 3**

Andrew is an avid archer. He launches an arrow that takes a parabolic path. The equation of the height of
the ball with respect to time is y = −4.9t2 + 48t, where y is the height of the arrow in meters and t is the
time in seconds since Andrew shot the arrow. Find how long it takes the arrow to come back to the ground.

**Solution:**

Let’s graph the equation by making a table of values.

                                              Table 10.13:

 t                                                      y = −4.9t2 + 48t
 0                                                      y = −4.9(0)2 + 48(0) = 0
 1                                                      y = −4.9(1)2 + 48(1) = 43.1
 2                                                      y = −4.9(2)2 + 48(2) = 76.4
 3                                                      y = −4.9(3)2 + 48(3) = 99.9
 4                                                      y = −4.9(4)2 + 48(4) = 113.6
 5                                                      y = −4.9(5)2 + 48(5) = 117.6
 6                                                      y = −4.9(6)2 + 48(6) = 111.6
 7                                                      y = −4.9(7)2 + 48(7) = 95.9
 8                                                      y = −4.9(8)2 + 48(8) = 70.4
 9                                                      y = −4.9(9)2 + 48(9) = 35.1
 10                                                     y = −4.9(10)2 + 48(10) = −10


Here’s the graph of the function:

The roots of the function are approximately x = 0 sec and x = 9.8 sec. The ﬁrst root tells us that the height
of the arrow was 0 meters when Andrew ﬁrst shot it. The second root says that it takes approximately
9.8 seconds for the arrow to return to the ground.

## 10.3 Quadratic Equations by Square Roots


### Learning Objectives

- Solve quadratic equations involving perfect squares.
- Approximate solutions of quadratic equations.
- Solve real-world problems using quadratic functions and square roots.


Introduction
So far you know how to solve quadratic equations by factoring. However, this method works only if a
quadratic polynomial can be factored. In the real world, most quadratics can’t be factored, so now we’ll
start to learn other methods we can use to solve them. In this lesson, we’ll examine equations in which we
can take the square root of both sides of the equation in order to arrive at the result.


Solve Quadratic Equations Involving Perfect Squares
Let’s ﬁrst examine quadratic equations of the type

                                                    x2 − c = 0

We can solve this equation by isolating the x2 term: x2 = c
Once the x2 term is isolated we can take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that
when we take the square root we get two answers: the positive square root and the negative square root:
                                            √                       √
                                       x=       c     and        x=− c

                              √
Often this is written as x = ± c.

**Example 1**

Solve the following quadratic equations:
a) x2 − 4 = 0
b) x2 − 25 = 0

**Solution:**

a) x2 − 4 = 0
Isolate the x2 : x2 = 4
                                            √              √
Take the square root of both sides: x =         4 and x = − 4
The solutions are x = 2 and x = −2.
b) x2 − 25 = 0
Isolate the x2 : x2 = 25
                                            √               √
Take the square root of both sides: x =         25 and x = − 25
The solutions are x = 5 and x = −5.
We can also ﬁnd the solution using the square root when the x2 term is multiplied by a constant—in other
words, when the equation takes the form

                                                    ax2 − c = 0

We just have to isolate the x2 :

                                                     ax2 = b
                                                           b
                                                      x2 =
                                                           a

Then we can take the square root of both sides of the equation:
                                        √                       √
                                           b                      b
                                    x=            and     x=−
                                           a                      a
                                   √
Often this is written as: x = ±        b
                                       a.


**Example 2**

Solve the following quadratic equations.
a) 9x2 − 16 = 0
b) 81x2 − 1 = 0

**Solution:**

a) 9x2 − 16 = 0
Isolate the x2 :

                                                     9x2 = 16
                                                      x2 =

                                                9 and x = −
                                               16                 16
Take the square root of both sides: x =                           9

Answer: x = 43 and x = − 43
b) 81x2 − 1 = 0
Isolate the x2 :

                                             81x2 = 1
                                               x2 =
                                       √             √
Take the square root of both sides: x = 81 and x = − 811


Answer: x = 19 and x = − 19
As you’ve seen previously, some quadratic equations have no real solutions.

**Example 3**

Solve the following quadratic equations.
a) x2 + 1 = 0
b) 4x2 + 9 = 0

**Solution:**

a) x2 + 1 = 0
Isolate the x2 : x2 = −1
                                           √               √
Take the square root of both sides: x =        −1 and x = − −1
Square roots of negative numbers do not give real number results, so there are no real solutions to this
equation.
b) 4x2 + 9 = 0
Isolate the x2 :

                                               4x2 = −9
                                                x2 = −
                                       √               √
Take the square root of both sides: x = − 94 and x = − − 94
There are no real solutions.
We can also use the square root function in some quadratic equations where one side of the equation is a
perfect square. This is true if an equation is of this form:

                                                   (x − 2)2 = 9

Both sides of the equation are perfect squares. We take the square root of both sides and end up with two
equations: x − 2 = 3 and x − 2 = −3.
Solving both equations gives us x = 5 and x = −1.

**Example 4**

Solve the following quadratic equations.

a) (x − 1)2 = 4
b) (x + 3)2 = 1

**Solution:**

a) (x − 1)2 = 4

                  Take the square root of both sides :                 x − 1 = 2 and x − 1 = −2
                                Solve each equation :                     x = 3 and x = −1

Answer: x = 3 and x = −1
b) (x + 3)2 = 1

                  Take the square root of both sides :                x + 3 = 1 and x + 3 = −1
                                Solve each equation :                     x = −2 and x = −4

Answer: x = −2 and x = −4
It might be necessary to factor the right-hand side of the equation as a perfect square before applying the
method outlined above.

**Example 5**

Solve the following quadratic equations.
a) x2 + 8x + 16 = 25
b) 4x2 − 40x + 25 = 9

**Solution:**

a) x2 + 8x + 16 = 25

         Factor the right-hand-side :                     x2 + 8x + 16 = (x + 4)2     so (x + 4)2 = 25
         Take the square root of both sides :             x + 4 = 5 and x + 4 = −5
         Solve each equation :                            x = 1 and x = −9

Answer: x = 1 and x = −9
b) 4x2 − 20x + 25 = 9

        Factor the right-hand-side :                     4x2 − 20x + 25 = (2x − 5)2    so (2x − 5)2 = 9
        Take the square root of both sides :             2x − 5 = 3 and 2x − 5 = −3
        Solve each equation :                            2x = 8 and 2x = 2

Answer: x = 4 and x = 1

           Take the square root of both sides :              2x + 5 = 10 and 2x + 5 = − 10
                                                                           √                 √

                         Solve both equations :                   x=          and x =
                                                                         2                 2
Answer: x ≈ −0.92 and x ≈ −4.08

Solve Real-World Problems Using Quadratic Functions and Square
Roots
Quadratic equations are needed to solve many real-world problems. In this section, we’ll examine problems
about objects falling under the inﬂuence of gravity. When objects are dropped from a height, they have
no initial velocity; the force that makes them move towards the ground is due to gravity. The acceleration
of gravity on earth is given by the equation

                                       g = −9.8 m/s2   or    g = −32 f t/s2

The negative sign indicates a downward direction. We can assume that gravity is constant for the problems
we’ll be examining, because we will be staying close to the surface of the earth. The acceleration of gravity
decreases as an object moves very far from the earth. It is also diﬀerent on other celestial bodies such as
the moon.
The equation that shows the height of an object in free fall is
                                                  y = gt2 + y0

The term y0 represents the initial height of the object, t is time, and g is the constant representing the
force of gravity. You then plug in one of the two values for g above, depending on whether you want the
answer in feet or meters. Thus the equation works out to y = −4.9t2 + y0 if you want the height in meters,
and y = −16t2 + y0 if you want it in feet.

**Example 8**

How long does it take a ball to fall from a roof to the ground 25 feet below?

**Solution:**


                Since we are given the height in feet, use equation :              y = −16t2 + y0
                              The initial height is y0 = 25 f eet, so :            y = −16t2 + 25
            The height when the ball hits the ground is y = 0, so :                0 = −16t2 + 25
                                                          Solve for t :         16t2 = 25
                                                                                  t2 =
                                                                                       5        5
                                                                                   t = or t = −
                                                                                       4        4

Since only positive time makes sense in this case, it takes the ball 1.25 seconds to fall to the ground.

**Example 9**

A rock is dropped from the top of a cliﬀ and strikes the ground 7.2 seconds later. How high is the cliﬀ in
meters?

**Solution:**


               Since we want the height in meters, use equation :           y = −4.9t2 + y0
                             The time of ﬂight is t = 7.2 seconds :         y = −4.9(7.2)2 + y0
          The height when the ball hits the ground is y = 0, so :          0 = −4.9(7.2)2 + y0
                                                          Simplify :       0 = −254 + y0 so y0 = 254

The cliﬀ is 254 meters high.

**Example 10**

Victor throws an apple out of a window on the 10th ﬂoor which is 120 feet above ground. One second later
Juan throws an orange out of a 6th ﬂoor window which is 72 feet above the ground. Which fruit reaches
the ground ﬁrst, and how much faster does it get there?

**Solution:**

Let’s ﬁnd the time of ﬂight for each piece of fruit.
Apple:

         Since we have the height in feet, use this equation :            y = −16t2 + y0
         The initial height is y0 = 120 f eet :                           y = −16t2 + 120
         The height when the ball hits the ground is y = 0, so :          0 = −16t2 + 120
         Solve for t :                                                    16t2 = 120
                                                                          t2 =      = 7.5
                                                                          t = 2.74 or t = −2.74 seconds

Orange:

              The initial height is y0 = 72 f eet :          0 = −16t2 + 72
              Solve for t :                                  16t2 = 72
                                                             t2 =     = 4.5
                                                             t = 2.12 or t = −2.12 seconds

The orange was thrown one second later, so add 1 second to the time of the orange: t = 3.12 seconds
The apple hits the ground ﬁrst. It gets there 0.38 seconds faster than the orange.

     the Square

### Learning Objectives

- Solve quadratic equations by completing the square.
- Solve quadratic equations in standard form.
- Graph quadratic equations in vertex form.
- Solve real-world problems using functions by completing the square.


Introduction
You saw in the last section that if you have a quadratic equation of the form (x − 2)2 = 5, you can easily
solve it by taking the square root of each side:
                                           √                         √
                                   x−2= 5         and      x−2=− 5

Simplify to get:
                                    √                                 √
                           x=2+         5 ≈ 4.24    and      x=2−         5 ≈ −0.24

So what do you do with an equation that isn’t written in this nice form? In this section, you’ll learn how
to rewrite any quadratic equation in this form by completing the square.


Complete the Square of a Quadratic Expression
Completing the square lets you rewrite a quadratic expression so that it contains a perfect square trinomial
that you can factor as the square of a binomial.
Remember that the square of a binomial takes one of the following forms:

                                           (x + a)2 = x2 + 2ax + a2
                                           (x − a)2 = x2 − 2ax + a2

So in order to have a perfect square trinomial, we need two terms that are perfect squares and one term
that is twice the product of the square roots of the other terms.

**Example 1**

Complete the square for the quadratic expression x2 + 4x.

**Solution:**

To complete the square we need a constant term that turns the expression into a perfect square trinomial.
Since the middle term in a perfect square trinomial is always 2 times the product of the square roots of
the other two terms, we re-write our expression as:

                                                 x2 + 2(2)(x)


We see that the constant we are seeking must be 22 :

                                             x2 + 2(2)(x) + 22


Answer: By adding 4 to both sides, this can be factored as: (x + 2)2
Notice, though, that we just changed the value of the whole expression by adding 4 to it. If it had been
an equation, we would have needed to add 4 to the other side as well to make up for this.
Also, this was a relatively easy example because a, the coeﬀicient of the x2 term, was 1. When that
coeﬀicient doesn’t equal 1, we have to factor it out from the whole expression before completing the
square.

**Example 2**

Complete the square for the quadratic expression 4x2 + 32x.

**Solution:**


        Factor the coeﬀicient of the x2 term :                               4(x2 + 8x)
        Now complete the square of the expression in parentheses.
        Re-write the expression :                                            4(x2 + 2(4)(x))
        We complete the square by adding the constant 42 :                   4(x2 + 2(4)(x) + 42 )
        Factor the perfect square trinomial inside the parenthesis :         4(x + 4)2     Answer


The expression “completing the square” comes from a geometric interpretation of this situation. Let’s
revisit the quadratic expression in Example 1: x2 + 4x.
We can think of this expression as the sum of three areas. The ﬁrst term represents the area of a square of
side x. The second expression represents the areas of two rectangles with a length of 2 and a width of x:


We can combine these shapes as follows:


We obtain a square that is not quite complete. To complete the square, we need to add a smaller square
of side length 2.

We end up with a square of side length (x + 2); its area is therefore (x + 2)2 .


Solve Quadratic Equations by Completing the Square
Let’s demonstrate the method of completing the square with an example.

**Example 3**

Solve the following quadratic equation: 3x2 − 10x = −1

**Solution:**

Divide all terms by the coeﬀicient of the x2 term:
                                                        10     1
                                                 x2 −      x=−
                                                        3      3
               ( )
Rewrite: x2 − 2 53 (x) = − 13 In order to have a perfect square trinomial on the right-hand-side we need to
                  ( )2
add the constant 35 . Add this constant to both sides of the equation:
                                            (5)           ( 5 )2     1 ( 5 )2

Answer: x = 3.23 and x = 0.1
If an equation is in standard form (ax2 + bx + c = 0), we can still solve it by the method of completing the
square. All we have to do is start by moving the constant term to the right-hand-side of the equation.

**Example 4**

Solve the following quadratic equation: x2 + 15x + 12 = 0

**Solution:**


Move the constant to the other side of the equation:

                                                    x2 + 15x = −12
               ( )
                 2 (x) = −12
Rewrite: x2 + 2 15
                  ( )2
Add the constant 152   to both sides of the equation:
                                           ( 15 )           ( 15 )2             ( 15 )2

Factor the perfect square trinomial and simplify:
                                            (    15 )2         225

                                                  2             4

Take the square root of both sides:
                    √                                                                       √

Answer: x = −0.85 and x = −14.15


Graph Quadratic Functions in Vertex Form
Probably one of the best applications of the method of completing the square is using it to rewrite a
quadratic function in vertex form. The vertex form of a quadratic function is

                                                 y − k = a(x − h)2

This form is very useful for graphing because it gives the vertex of the parabola explicitly. The vertex is
at the point (h, k).
It is also simple to ﬁnd the x−intercepts from the vertex form: just set y = 0 and take the square root of
both sides of the resulting equation.
To ﬁnd the y−intercept, set x = 0 and simplify.

**Example 5**

Find the vertex, the x−intercepts and the y−intercept of the following parabolas:
a) y − 2 = (x − 1)2
b) y + 8 = 2(x − 3)2

**Solution:**

a) y − 2 = (x − 1)2
Vertex: (1, 2)
To ﬁnd the x−intercepts,

                                   Set y = 0 :              −2 = (x − 1)2
                                                        √                                        √
       Take the square root of both sides :                 −2 = x − 1            and        −       −2 = x − 1

The solutions are not real so there are no x−intercepts.
To ﬁnd the y−intercept,

                            Set x = 0 :                                y − 2 = (−1)2
                             Simplify :                                y−2=1⇒y=3

b) y + 8 = 2(x − 3)2

                            Rewrite :                                y − (−8) = 2(x − 3)2
                            Vertex :                                 (3, −8)

To ﬁnd the x−intercepts,

                                       Set y = 0 :          8 = 2(x − 3)2
                       Divide both sides by 2 :             4 = (x − 3)2
        Take the square root of both sides :                4= x−3                and            −4= x−3
                                       Simplify :            x=7                  and            x = −1

To ﬁnd the y−intercept,

                           Set x = 0 :                               y + 8 = 2(−3)2
                            Simplify :                               y + 8 = 18 ⇒ y = 10

To graph a parabola, we only need to know the following information:

- the vertex
- the x−intercepts
- the y−intercept
- whether the parabola turns up or down (remember that it turns up if a > 0 and down if a < 0)


**Example 6**

Graph the parabola given by the function y + 1 = (x + 3)2 .

**Solution:**


               Rewrite :                    y − (−1) = (x − (−3))2
               Vertex :                     (−3, −1)                               vertex : (−3, −1)

To ﬁnd the x−intercepts,

            Set y = 0 :                                            1 = (x + 3)2
            Take the square root of both sides :                   1= x+3         and       −1= x+3
            Simplify :                                             x = −2         and        x = −4
                                                                   x − intercepts : (−2, 0) and (−4, 0)

To ﬁnd the y−intercept,

                Set x = 0 :                  y + 1 = (3)2
                Simplify:                    y=8                          y − intercept : (0, 8)

And since a > 0, the parabola turns up.
Graph all the points and connect them with a smooth curve:


**Example 7**

Graph the parabola given by the function y = − 12 (x − 2)2 .

**Solution:**

                 Rewrite                   y − (0) = − (x − 2)2
                 Vertex:                   (2, 0)                                vertex:(2, 0)

To ﬁnd the x−intercepts,
                                    Set y = 0 :          0 = − (x − 2)2
                 Multiply both sides by − 2 :            0 = (x − 2)2
         Take the square root of both sides :            0= x−2
                                     Simplify :             x=2                    x − intercept:(2, 0)

Note: there is only one x−intercept, indicating that the vertex is located at this point, (2, 0).
To ﬁnd the y−intercept,
              Set x = 0 :               y = − (−2)2
                Simplify:               y = − (4) ⇒ y = −2                  y − intercept:(0, −2)

Since a < 0, the parabola turns down.

Graph all the points and connect them with a smooth curve:


Solve Real-World Problems Using Quadratic Functions by Com-
pleting the Square
In the last section you learned that an object that is dropped falls under the inﬂuence of gravity. The
equation for its height with respect to time is given by y = 12 gt2 + y0 , where y0 represents the initial height
of the object and g is the coeﬀicient of gravity on earth, which equals −9.8 m/s2 or −32 f t/s2 .
On the other hand, if an object is thrown straight up or straight down in the air, it has an initial vertical
velocity. This term is usually represented by the notation v0y . Its value is positive if the object is thrown
up in the air and is negative if the object is thrown down. The equation for the height of the object in this
case is

                                              y = gt2 + v0y t + y0

Plugging in the appropriate value for g turns this equation into
y = −4.9t2 + v0y t + y0 if you wish to have the height in meters
y = −16t2 + v0y t + y0 if you wish to have the height in feet

**Example 8**

An arrow is shot straight up from a height of 2 meters with a velocity of 50 m/s.
a) How high will the arrow be 4 seconds after being shot? After 8 seconds?
b) At what time will the arrow hit the ground again?
c) What is the maximum height that the arrow will reach and at what time will that happen?

**Solution:**

Since we are given the velocity in m/s, use: y = −4.9t2 + v0y t + y0
We know v0y = 50 m/s and y0 = 2 meters so: y = −4.9t2 + 50t + 2
a) To ﬁnd how high the arrow will be 4 seconds after being shot we plug in t = 4:

                                   y = −4.9(4)2 + 50(4) + 2
                                     = −4.9(16) + 200 + 2 = 123.6 f eet


we plug in t = 8:

                                    y = −4.9(8)2 + 50(8) + 2
                                        = −4.9(64) + 400 + 2 = 88.4 f eet


b) The height of the ball arrow on the ground is y = 0, so: 0 = −4.9t2 + 50t + 2
Solve for t by completing the square:

                                    −4.9t2 + 50t = −2
                                 −4.9(t2 − 10.2t) = −2
                                         t2 − 10.2t = 0.41
                             t2 − 2(5.1)t + (5.1)2 = 0.41 + (5.1)2
                                         (t − 5.1)2 = 26.43
                                            t − 5.1 = 5.14 and t − 5.1 = −5.14
                                                 t = 10.2 sec and t = −0.04 sec

The arrow will hit the ground about 10.2 seconds after it is shot.
c) If we graph the height of the arrow with respect to time we would get an upside down parabola (a < 0).
The maximum height and the time when this occurs is really the vertex of this parabola: (t, h).

       We re-write the equation in vertex form:              y = −4.9t2 + 50t + 2
                                                             y − 2 = −4.9t2 + 50t
                                                             y − 2 = −4.9(t2 − 10.2t)
                                                                                     (                    )
       Complete the square:                                  y − 2 − 4.9(5.1)2 = −4.9 t2 − 10.2t + (5.1)2
                                                             y − 129.45 = −4.9(t − 5.1)2

The vertex is at (5.1, 129.45). In other words, when t = 5.1 seconds, the height is y = 129 meters.
Another type of application problem that can be solved using quadratic equations is one where two objects
are moving away from each other in perpendicular directions. Here is an example of this type of problem.

**Example 9**

Two cars leave an intersection. One car travels north; the other travels east. When the car traveling north
had gone 30 miles, the distance between the cars was 10 miles more than twice the distance traveled by the
car heading east. Find the distance between the cars at that time.

**Solution:**

Let x = the distance traveled by the car heading east
Then 2x + 10 = the distance between the two cars
Let’s make a sketch:

We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to ﬁnd an equation for x:

                                            x2 + 302 = (2x + 10)2

Expand parentheses and simplify:

                                        x2 + 900 = 4x2 + 40x + 100
                                              800 = 3x2 + 40x

Solve by completing the square:
                                           800          40
                                                 = x2 + x

     Formula

### Learning Objectives

Introduction
The Quadratic Formula is probably the most used method for solving quadratic equations. For a
quadratic equation in standard form, ax2 + bx + c = 0, the quadratic formula looks like this:
                                                    √
                                              −b ± b2 − 4ac
                                          x=
                                                     2a

This formula is derived by solving a general quadratic equation using the method of completing the square
that you learned in the previous section.

We start with a general quadratic equation: ax2 + bx + c = 0
Subtract the constant term from both sides: ax2 + bx = −c


                                                                      b      c
Divide by the coeﬀicient of the x2 term:                       x2 + x = −
                                                                 ( a)        a

                                    Rewrite:             x2 + 2         x=−
                                                                   2a        a

 Add the constant              to both sides:   x2 + 2      x+            =− + 2

You can see that the familiar formula comes directly from applying the method of completing the square.
Applying the method of completing the square to solve quadratic equations can be tedious, so the quadratic
formula is a more straightforward way of ﬁnding the solutions.

Answer: x = −.39 and x = .64
Often when we plug the values of the coeﬀicients into the quadratic formula, we end up with a negative
number inside the square root. Since the square root of a negative number does not give real answers, we
say that the equation has no real solutions. In more advanced math classes, you’ll learn how to work with
“complex” (or “imaginary”) solutions to quadratic equations.

To apply the quadratic formula, we must make sure that the equation is written in standard form. For
some problems, that means we have to start by rewriting the equation.

Finding the Vertex of a Parabola with the Quadratic Formula
Sometimes a formula gives you even more information than you were looking for. For example, the quadratic
formula also gives us an easy way to locate the vertex of a parabola.
Remember that the quadratic
                       √
                                formula tells us the roots or solutions
                                                                     √
                                                                        of the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0.
                    −b± b2 −4ac                                  −b   b2 −4ac
Those roots are x =     2a      , and we can rewrite that as x = 2a ± 2a
Recall that the roots are symmetric about the vertex. In the form above, we can√see that the roots of a
quadratic equation are symmetric around the x−coordinate −b    2a , because they are
                                                                                       b2 −4ac
                                                                                        2a     units to the left
and right (recall the ± sign) from the vertical line x = −b
                                                         2a . For   example, in the equation   x2 − 2x − 3 = 0,
the roots -1 and 3 are both 2 units from the vertical line x = 1, as you can see in the graph below:


Identify and Choose Methods for Solving Quadratic Equations.
In mathematics, you’ll need to solve quadratic equations that describe application problems or that are
part of more complicated problems. You’ve learned four ways of solving a quadratic equation:


- Factoring
- Taking the square root
- Completing the square
- Quadratic formula


Usually you’ll have to decide for yourself which method to use. However, here are some guidelines as to
which methods are better in diﬀerent situations.

Factoring is always best if the quadratic expression is easily factorable. It is always worthwhile to check
if you can factor because this is the fastest method. Many expressions are not factorable so this method is
not used very often in practice.
Taking the square root is best used when there is no x−term in the equation.
Completing the square can be used to solve any quadratic equation. This is usually not any better
than using the quadratic formula (in terms of diﬀicult computations), but it is very useful if you need
to rewrite a quadratic function in vertex form. It’s also used to rewrite the equations of circles, ellipses
and hyperbolas in standard form (something you’ll do in algebra II, trigonometry, physics, calculus, and
beyond).
Quadratic formula is the method that is used most often for solving a quadratic equation. When solving
directly by taking square root and factoring does not work, this is the method that most people prefer to
use.
If you are using factoring or the quadratic formula, make sure that the equation is in standard form.

**Example 4**

Solve each quadratic equation.
a) x2 − 4x − 5 = 0
b) x2 = 8
c) −4x2 + x = 2
d) 25x2 − 9 = 0
e) 3x2 = 8x

**Solution:**

a) This expression if easily factorable so we can factor and apply the zero-product property:

                  Factor:                                       (x − 5)(x + 1) = 0
                  Apply zero-product property:                  x−5=0       and    x+1=0
                  Solve:                                        x=5          and   x = −1

Answer: x = 5 and x = −1
b) Since the expression is missing the x term we can take the square root:
                                         √            √
Take the square root of both sides: x = 8 and x = − 8
Answer: x = 2.83 and x = −2.83
c) Re-write the equation in standard form: −4x2 + x − 2 = 0
It is not apparent right away if the expression is factorable so we will use the quadratic formula:
                                                                            √
                                                                     −b ±b2 − 4ac
                                   Quadratic formula:           x=
                                                                       √2a
                                                                   −1 ± 12 − 4(−4)(−2)
            Plug in the values a = −4, b = 1, c = −2 :          x=
                                                                          2(−4)
                                                                       √               √
                                                                   −1 ± 1 − 32    −1 ± −31
                                             Simplify:          x=              =
                                                                       −8             −8

Answer: no real solution

d) This problem can be solved easily either with factoring or taking the square root. Let’s take the square
root in this case:
             Add 9 to both sides of the equation:                 25x2 = 9
                         Divide both sides by 25 :                  x2 =
                                                                         √               √

               Take the square root of both sides:                   x=      and x = −
                                                                          25                 25
                                                                        3          3
                                          Simplify:                  x = and x = −
                                                                        5          5
Answer: x = 35 and x = − 35
e)         Re-write the equation in standard form:                3x2 − 8x = 0
                        Factor out common x term:                 x(3x − 8) = 0
                              Set both terms to zero:                    x = 0 and 3x = 8
                                               Solve:                    x = 0 and x = = 2.67
Answer: x = 0 and x = 2.67

Here are some application problems that arise from number relationships and geometry applications.

**Example 5**

The product of two positive consecutive integers is 156. Find the integers.

**Solution:**

Deﬁne: Let x = the smaller integer
Then x + 1 = the next integer
Translate: The product of the two numbers is 156. We can write the equation:
                                               x(x + 1) = 156

Solve:
                                                   x2 + x = 156
                                             x2 + x − 156 = 0

                                      2                     2

Since we are looking for positive integers, we want x = 12. So the numbers are 12 and 13.
Check: 12 × 13 = 156. The answer checks out.

**Example 6**

The length of a rectangular pool is 10 meters more than its width. The area of the pool is 875 square
meters. Find the dimensions of the pool.

**Solution:**

Draw a sketch:


Deﬁne: Let x = the width of the pool
Then x + 10 = the length of the pool
Translate: The area of a rectangle is A = length × width, so we have x(x + 10) = 875.
Solve:

                                                 x2 + 10x = 875
                                          x2 + 10x − 875 = 0

Apply the quadratic formula with a = 1, b = 10 and c = −875

                                        2                 2

Since the dimensions of the pool should be positive, we want x = 25 meters. So the pool is 25 meters ×
35 meters.
Check: 25 × 35 = 875 m2 . The answer checks out.

**Example 7**

Suzie wants to build a garden that has three separate rectangular sections. She wants to fence around the
whole garden and between each section as shown. The plot is twice as long as it is wide and the total area
is 200 f t2 . How much fencing does Suzie need?

**Solution:**

Deﬁne: Let x = the width of the plot
Then 2x = the length of the plot

Translate: area of a rectangle is A = length × width, so

                                                  x(2x) = 200

Solve: 2x2 = 200
Solve by taking the square root:

                                           x2 = 100
                                                √            √
                                            x = 100 and x = − 100
                                           x = 10 and x = −10

We take x = 10 since only positive dimensions make sense.
The plot of land is 10 f eet × 20 f eet.
To fence the garden the way Suzie wants, we need 2 lengths and 4 widths = 2(20) + 4(10) = 80 feet of
fence.
Check: 10 × 20 = 200 f t2 and 2(20) + 4(10) = 80 f eet. The answer checks out.

**Example 8**

An isosceles triangle is enclosed in a square so that its base coincides with one of the sides of the square
and the tip of the triangle touches the opposite side of the square. If the area of the triangle is 20 in2 what
is the length of one side of the square?

**Solution:**

Draw a sketch:


Deﬁne: Let x = base of the triangle
Then x = height of the triangle
Translate: Area of a triangle is 12 × base × height, so 12 · x · x = 20
Solve: 21 x2 = 20
Solve by taking the square root:

                                           x2 = 40
                                                √           √
                                            x = 40 and x = − 40
                                            x = 6.32 and x = −6.32

The side of the square is 6.32 inches. That means the area of the square is (6.32)2 = 40 in2 , twice as big
as the area of the triangle.
Check: It makes sense that the area of the square will be twice that of the triangle. If you look at the
ﬁgure you can see that you could ﬁt two triangles inside the square.

## 10.6 The Discriminant


### Learning Objectives

- Find the discriminant of a quadratic equation.

- Interpret the discriminant of a quadratic equation.
- Solve real-world problems using quadratic functions and interpreting the discriminant.


Introduction
                                  √
In the quadratic formula, x = −b± 2a
                                   b −4ac
                                          , the expression inside the square root is called the discriminant.
The discriminant can be used to analyze the types of solutions to a quadratic equation without actually
solving the equation. Here’s how:


- If b2 − 4ac > 0, the equation has two separate real solutions.
- If b2 − 4ac < 0, the equation has only non-real solutions.
- If b2 − 4ac = 0, the equation has one real solution, a double root.


Find the Discriminant of a Quadratic Equation
To ﬁnd the discriminant of a quadratic equation we calculate D = b2 − 4ac.

**Example 1**

Find the discriminant of each quadratic equation. Then tell how many solutions there will be to the
quadratic equation without solving.
a) x2 − 5x + 3 = 0
b) 4x2 − 4x + 1 = 0
c) −2x2 + x = 4

**Solution:**

a) Plug a = 1, b = −5 and c = 3 into the discriminant formula: D = (−5)2 − 4(1)(3) = 13 D > 0, so there
are two real solutions.
b) Plug a = 4, b = −4 and c = 1 into the discriminant formula: D = (−4)2 − 4(4)(1) = 0 D = 0, so there is
one real solution.
c) Rewrite the equation in standard form: −2x2 + x − 4 = 0
Plug a = −2, b = 1 and c = −4 into the discriminant formula: D = (1)2 − 4(−2)(−4) = −31 D < 0, so there
are no real solutions.


Interpret the Discriminant of a Quadratic Equation
The sign of the discriminant tells us the nature of the solutions (or roots) of a quadratic equation. We can
obtain two distinct real solutions if D > 0, two non-real solutions if D < 0 or one solution (called a double
root) if D = 0. Recall that the number of solutions of a quadratic equation tells us how many times its
graph crosses the x−axis. If D > 0, the graph crosses the x−axis in two places; if D = 0 it crosses in one
place; if D < 0 it doesn’t cross at all:


**Example 2**

Determine the nature of the solutions of each quadratic equation.
a) 4x2 − 1 = 0
b) 10x2 − 3x = −4
c) x2 − 10x + 25 = 0

**Solution:**

Use the value of the discriminant to determine the nature of the solutions to the quadratic equation.
a) Plug a = 4, b = 0 and c = −1 into the discriminant formula: D = (0)2 − 4(4)(−1) = 16
The discriminant is positive, so the equation has two distinct real solutions.
                                          √
The solutions to the equation are: 0± 8 16 = ± 48 = ± 12
b) Re-write the equation in standard form: 10x2 − 3x + 4 = 0
Plug a = 10, b = −3 and c = 4 into the discriminant formula: D = (−3)2 − 4(10)(4) = −151
The discriminant is negative, so the equation has two non-real solutions.
c) Plug a = 1, b = −10 and c = 25 into the discriminant formula: D = (−10)2 − 4(1)(25) = 0
The discriminant is 0, so the equation has a double root.
                                      √
The solution to the equation is: 10±2 0 = 10
                                          2 =5
If the discriminant is a perfect square, then the solutions to the equation are not only real, but also rational.
If the discriminant is positive but not a perfect square, then the solutions to the equation are real but
irrational.

**Example 3**

Determine the nature of the solutions to each quadratic equation.
a) 2x2 + x − 3 = 0
b) 5x2 − x − 1 = 0

**Solution:**

Use the discriminant to determine the nature of the solutions.
a) Plug a = 2, b = 1 and c = −3 into the discriminant formula: D = (1)2 − 4(2)(−3) = 25
The discriminant is a positive perfect square, so the solutions are two real rational numbers.
                                          √
The solutions to the equation are: −1±4 25 = −1±5
                                              4 , so x = 1 and x = − 2 .

b) Plug a = 5, b = −1 and c = −1 into the discriminant formula: D = (−1)2 − 4(5)(−1) = 21


The discriminant is positive but not a perfect square, so the solutions are two real irrational numbers.
                                       √
The solutions to the equation are: 1±1021 , so x ≈ 0.56 and x ≈ −0.36.


Solve Real-World Problems Using Quadratic Functions and In-
terpreting the Discriminant
You’ve seen that calculating the discriminant shows what types of solutions a quadratic equation possesses.
Knowing the types of solutions is very useful in applied problems. Consider the following situation.

**Example 4**

Marcus kicks a football in order to score a ﬁeld goal. The height of the ball is given by the equation
y = − 6400
        32 2
           x + x. If the goalpost is 10 feet high, can Marcus kick the ball high enough to go over the
goalpost? What is the farthest distance that Marcus can kick the ball from and still make it over the
goalpost?

**Solution:**

Deﬁne: Let y = height of the ball in feet.
Let x = distance from the ball to the goalpost.
Translate: We want to know if it is possible for the height of the ball to equal 10 feet at some real distance
from the goalpost.
Solve:

                                                                    32 2
            Write the equation in standard form:                 −      x + x − 10 = 0
            Simplify:                                            − 0.005x2 + x − 10 = 0
            Find the discriminant:                               D = (1)2 − 4(−0.005)(−10) = 0.8

Since the discriminant is positive, we know that it is possible for the ball to go over the goal post, if Marcus
kicks it from an acceptable distance x from the goalpost.
To ﬁnd the value of x that will work, we need to use the quadratic formula:
                                          √
                                     −1 ± 0.8
                                  x=          = 189.4 f eet or 10.56 f eet
                                       −0.01

What does this answer mean? It means that if Marcus is exactly 189.4 feet or exactly 10.56 feet from the
goalposts, the ball will just barely go over them. Are these the only distances that will work? No; those
are just the distances at which the ball will be exactly 10 feet high, but between those two distances, the
ball will go even higher than that. (It travels in a downward-opening parabola from the place where it is
kicked to the spot where it hits the ground.) This means that Marcus will make the goal if he is anywhere
between 10.56 and 189.4 feet from the goalposts.

**Example 5**

Emma and Bradon own a factory that produces bike helmets. Their accountant says that their proﬁt per
year is given by the function P = −0.003x2 + 12x + 27760, where x is the number of helmets produced. Their
goal is to make a proﬁt of $40,000 this year. Is this possible?

**Solution:**

We want to know if it is possible for the proﬁt to equal $40,000.

                                    40000 = −0.003x2 + 12x + 27760

Write the equation in standard form: −0.003x2 + 12x − 12240 = 0
Find the discriminant: D = (12)2 − 4(−0.003)(−12240) = −2.88
Since the discriminant is negative, we know that it is not possible for Emma and Bradon to make a
proﬁt of $40,000 this year no matter how many helmets they make.

## 10.7 Linear, Exponential and Quadratic Models


### Learning Objectives

- Identify functions using diﬀerences and ratios.
- Write equations for functions.
- Perform exponential and quadratic regressions with a graphing calculator.
- Solve real-world problems by comparing function models.


Introduction
In this course we’ve learned about three types of functions, linear, quadratic and exponential.

- Linear functions take the form y = mx + b.
- Quadratic functions take the form y = ax2 + bx + c.
- Exponential functions take the form y = a · b x .

In real-world applications, the function that describes some physical situation is not given; it has to be
found before the problem can be solved. For example, scientiﬁc data such as observations of planetary
motion are often collected as a set of measurements given in a table. Part of the scientist’s job is to ﬁgure
out which function best ﬁts the data. In this section, you’ll learn some methods that are used to identify
which function describes the relationship between the variables in a problem.


Identify Functions Using Diﬀerences or Ratios
One method for identifying functions is to look at the diﬀerence or the ratio of diﬀerent values of the
dependent variable. For example, if the diﬀerence between values of the dependent variable
is the same each time we change the independent variable by the same amount, then the
function is linear.

**Example 1**

Determine if the function represented by the following table of values is linear.

                                               Table 10.14:

 x                                                     y
 −2                                                    –4
 –1                                                    –1
 0                                                     2
 1                                                     5
 2                                                     8


If we take the diﬀerence between consecutive y−values, we see that each time the x−value increases by one,
the y−value always increases by 3.
Since the diﬀerence is always the same, the function is linear.
When we look at the diﬀerence of the y−values, we have to make sure that we examine entries for which

the x−values increase by the same amount.
For example, examine the values in this table:

                                               Table 10.15:

 x                                                      y
 0                                                      5
 1                                                      10
 3                                                      20
 4                                                      25
 6                                                      35


At ﬁrst glance this function might not look linear, because the diﬀerence in the y−values is not always the
same. But if we look closer, we can see that when the y−value increases by 10 instead of 5, it’s because
the x−value increased by 2 instead of 1. Whenever the x−value increases by the same amount, the y−value
does too, so the function is linear.
Another way to think of this is in mathematical notation. We can say that a function is linear if yx22 −y
                                                                                                       −x1 is

always the same for any two pairs of x− and y−values. Notice that the expression we used here is simply
the deﬁnition of the slope of a line.
Diﬀerences can also be used to identify quadratic functions. For a quadratic function, when we
increase the x−values by the same amount, the diﬀerence between y−values will not be the
same. However, the diﬀerence of the diﬀerences of the y−values will be the same.
Here are some examples of quadratic relationships represented by tables of values:


In this quadratic function, y = x2 , when we increase the x−value by one, the value of y increases by diﬀerent
values. However, it increases at a constant rate, so the diﬀerence of the diﬀerence is always 2.

In this quadratic function, y = 2x2 − 3x + 1, when we increase the x−value by one, the value of y increases
by diﬀerent values. However, the increase is constant: the diﬀerence of the diﬀerence is always 4.
To identify exponential functions, we use ratios instead of diﬀerences. If the ratio between values of
the dependent variable is the same each time we change the independent variable by the
same amount, then the function is exponential.

**Example 2**

Determine if the function represented by each table of values is exponential.
a)


b)


a) If we take the ratio of consecutive y−values, we see that each time the x−value increases by one, the
y−value is multiplied by 3. Since the ratio is always the same, the function is exponential.
b) If we take the ratio of consecutive y−values, we see that each time the x−value increases by one, the
y−value is multiplied by 21 . Since the ratio is always the same, the function is exponential.


Write Equations for Functions
Once we identify which type of function ﬁts the given values, we can write an equation for the function by
starting with the general form for that type of function.

**Example 3**

Determine what type of function represents the values in the following table.

                                               Table 10.16:

 x                                                      y
 0                                                      5
 1                                                      1
 2                                                      -3
 3                                                      -7
 4                                                      -11


**Solution:**

Let’s ﬁrst check the diﬀerence of consecutive values of y.


If we take the diﬀerence between consecutive y−values, we see that each time the x−value increases by one,
the y−value always decreases by 4. Since the diﬀerence is always the same, the function is linear.
To ﬁnd the equation for the function, we start with the general form of a linear function: y = mx + b. Since
m is the slope of the line, it’s also the quantity by which y increases every time the value of x increases by
one. The constant b is the value of the function when x = 0. Therefore, the function is y = −4x + 5.

**Example 4**

Determine what type of function represents the values in the following table.


                                              Table 10.17:

 x                                                     y
 0                                                     0
 1                                                     5
 2                                                     20
 3                                                     45
 4                                                     80
 5                                                     125
 6                                                     180


**Solution:**

Here, the diﬀerence between consecutive y−values isn’t constant, so the function is not linear. Let’s look
at those diﬀerences more closely.

                                              Table 10.18:

 x                                   y
 0                                   0
 1                                   5                                  5−0=5
 2                                   20                                 20 − 5 = 15
 3                                   45                                 45 − 20 = 25
 4                                   80                                 80 − 45 = 35
 5                                   125                                125 − 80 = 45
 6                                   180                                180 − 125 = 55


When the x−value increases by one, the diﬀerence between the y−values increases by 10 every time. Since
the diﬀerence of the diﬀerences is constant, the function describing this set of values is quadratic.
To ﬁnd the equation for the function that represents these values, we start with the general form of a
quadratic function: y = ax2 + bx + c.
We need to use the values in the table to ﬁnd the values of the constants: a, b and c.
The value of c represents the value of the function when x = 0, so c = 0.

                                   Plug in the point (1, 5) :         5=a+b
                                  Plug in the point (2, 20) :        20 = 4a + 2b ⇒ 10 = 2a + b
         To ﬁnd a and b, we solve the system of equations:            5=a+b
                                                                     10 = 2a + b
                             Solve the ﬁrst equation for b :          5=a+b⇒b=5−a
                    Plug the ﬁrst equation into the second:          10 = 2a + 5 − a
                                           Solve for a and b          a = 5 and b = 0

Therefore the equation of the quadratic function is y = 5x2 .

**Example 5**

Determine what type of function represents the values in the following table.


                                               Table 10.19:

 x                                                     y
 0                                                     400
 1                                                     500
 2                                                     25
 3                                                     6.25
 4                                                     1.5625


**Solution:**

The diﬀerences between consecutive y−values aren’t the same, and the diﬀerences between those diﬀerences
aren’t the same either. So let’s check the ratios instead.


Each time the x−value increases by one, the y−value is multiplied by 41 . Since the ratio is always the same,
the function is exponential.
To ﬁnd the equation for the function that represents these values, we start with the general form of an
exponential function, y = a · b x .
Here b is the ratio between the values of y each time x is increased
                                                             ( )x    by one. The constant a is the value of
the function when x = 0. Therefore, the function is y = 400 14 .

The following table shows how many miles per gallon a car gets at diﬀerent speeds.

Using a graphing calculator:
a) Draw the scatterplot of the data.
b) Find the quadratic function of best ﬁt.
c) Draw the quadratic function of best ﬁt on the scatterplot.
d) Find the speed that maximizes the miles per gallon.
e) Predict the miles per gallon of the car if you drive at a speed of 48 mph.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Input the data.
Press [STAT] and choose the [EDIT] option.
Input the values of x in the ﬁrst column (L1 ) and the values of y in the second column (L2 ). (Note: in
order to clear a list, move the cursor to the top so that L1 or L2 is highlighted. Then press [CLEAR] and
then [ENTER].)
Step 2: Draw the scatterplot.
First press [Y=] and clear any function on the screen by pressing [CLEAR] when the old function is
highlighted.
Press [STATPLOT] [STAT] and [Y=] and choose option 1.
Choose the ON option; after TYPE, choose the ﬁrst graph type (scatterplot) and make sure that the Xlist
and Ylist names match the names on top of the columns in the input table.
Press [GRAPH] and make sure that the window is set so you see all the points in the scatterplot. In
this case, the settings should be 30 ≤ x ≤ 80 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 40. You can set the window size by pressing the
[WINDOW] key at the top.
Step 3: Perform quadratic regression.
Press [STAT] and use the right arrow to choose [CALC].
Choose Option 5 (QuadReg) and press [ENTER]. You will see “QuadReg” on the screen.
Type in L1 , L2 after ‘QuadReg’ and press [ENTER]. The calculator shows the quadratic function: y =
−0.017x2 + 1.9x − 25
Step 4: Graph the function.
Press [Y=] and input the function you just found.
Press [GRAPH] and you will see the curve ﬁt drawn over the data points.

To ﬁnd the speed that maximizes the miles per gallon, use [TRACE] and move the cursor to the top of
the parabola. You can also use [CALC] [2nd] [TRACE] and option 4:Maximum, for a more accurate
answer. The speed that maximizes miles per gallon is 56 mph.
Finally, plug x = 48 into the equation you found: y = −0.017(48)2 + 1.9(48) − 25 = 27.032 miles per gallon.
Note: The image above shows our function plotted on the same graph as the data points from the table.
One thing that is clear from this graph is that predictions made with this function won’t make sense for
all values of x. For example, if x < 15, this graph predicts that we will get negative mileage, which is
impossible. Part of the skill of using regression on your calculator is being aware of the strengths and
limitations of this method of ﬁtting functions to data.

 1998                                                 $5800
 1999                                                 $6300
 2000                                                 $6800

 2002                                                 $7900
 2003                                                 $8600
 2004                                                 $9300
 2005                                                 $10000
 2006                                                 $11000


Using a graphing calculator:
a) Draw a scatterplot of the value of the account as the dependent variable, and the number of years since

1996 as the independent variable.
b) Find the exponential function that ﬁts the data.
c) Draw the exponential function on the scatterplot.
d) What will be the value of the account in 2020?

**Solution:**

Step 1: Input the data.
Press [STAT] and choose the [EDIT] option.
Input the values of x in the ﬁrst column (L1 ) and the values of y in the second column (L2 ).
Step 2: Draw the scatterplot.
First press [Y=] and clear any function on the screen.
Press [GRAPH] and choose Option 1.
Choose the ON option and make sure that the Xlist and Ylist names match the names on top of the
columns in the input table.
Press [GRAPH] make sure that the window is set so you see all the points in the scatterplot. In this case
the settings should be 0 ≤ x ≤ 10 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 11000.
Step 3: Perform exponential regression.
Press [STAT] and use the right arrow to choose [CALC].
Choose Option 0 and press [ENTER]. You will see “ExpReg” on the screen.
Press [ENTER]. The calculator shows the exponential function: y = 4975.7(1.08) x
Step 4: Graph the function.
Press [Y=] and input the function you just found. Press [GRAPH].
Finally, plug x = 2020 − 1996 = 24 into the function: y = 4975.7(1.08)24 = $31551.81
In 2020, the account will have a value of $31551.81.
Note: The function above is the curve that comes closest to all the data points. It won’t return y−values
that are exactly the same as in the data table, but they will be close. It is actually more accurate to use
the curve ﬁt values than the data points.
If you don’t have a graphing calculator, there are resources available on the Internet for ﬁnding lines
and curves of best ﬁt. For example, the applet at http://science.kennesaw.edu/~plaval/applets/
LRegression.html does linear regression on a set of data points; the one at http://science.kennesaw.
edu/~plaval/applets/QRegression.html does quadratic regression; and the one at http://science.
kennesaw.edu/~plaval/applets/ERegression.html does exponential regression. Also, programs like
Microsoft Oﬀice or OpenOﬀice have the ability to create graphs and charts that include lines and curves
of best ﬁt.

**Solution:**

We need to perform linear, quadratic and exponential regression on this data set to see which function
represents the values in the table the best.
Step 1: Input the data.
Input the values of x in the ﬁrst column (L1 ) and the values of y in the second column (L2 ).
Step 2: Draw the scatterplot.
Set the window size: 0 ≤ x ≤ 10 and 20 ≤ y ≤ 40.
Here is the scatterplot:


Step 3: Perform Regression.
Linear Regression
The function of the line of best ﬁt is y = 0.51x + 26.1. Here is the graph of the function on the scatterplot:

Quadratic Regression
The quadratic function of best ﬁt is y = 0.064x2 − .067x + 26.84. Here is the graph of the function on the
scatterplot:


Exponential Regression
The exponential function of best ﬁt is y = 26.2(1.018) x . Here is the graph of the function on the scatterplot:


From the graphs, it looks like the quadratic function is the best ﬁt for this data set. We’ll use this function
to predict school enrollment in 2007.
Plug in x = 2007 − 1990 = 17 : y = 0.064(17)2 − .067(17) + 26.84 = 44.2 million students.

## 11.1 Graphs of Square Root Functions


### Learning Objectives

- Graph and compare square root functions.
- Shift graphs of square root functions.
- Graph square root functions using a graphing calculator.
- Solve real-world problems using square root functions.


Introduction
In this chapter you’ll learn about a diﬀerent kind of function called the square root function. You’ve seen
that taking the square root is very useful in solving
                                                   √ quadratic
                                                         √ equations. For example, to solve the equation
x2 = 25 we take the square root of both sides: x2 = ± 25, so x = ±5.
                                                             √
A square root function is any function with the form: y = a f (x) + c —in other words, any function where
an expression in terms of x is found inside a square root sign (also called a “radical” sign), although other
terms may be included as well.


Graph and Compare Square Root Functions
When working with square root functions, you’ll have to consider the domain of the function before
graphing. The domain is very important because the function is undeﬁned when the expression inside the
square root sign is negative, and as a result there will be no graph in whatever region of x−values makes
that true.
To discover how the graphs of square root functions behave, let’s make a table of values and plot the points.

**Example 1**

                         √
Graph the function y =       x.

**Solution:**


Before we make a table of values, we need to ﬁnd the domain of this square root function. The domain is
found by realizing that the function is only deﬁned when the expression inside the square root is greater
than or equal to zero. Since the expression inside the square root is just x, that means the domain is all
values of x such that x ≥ 0.
This means that when we make our table of values, we should pick values of x that are greater than or
equal to zero. It is very useful to include zero itself as the ﬁrst value in the table and also include many
values greater than zero. This will help us in determining what the shape of the curve will be.

                                               Table 11.1:
                                                             √
 x                                                     y=    x
                                                           √
 0                                                     y = √0 = 0
 1                                                     y = √1 = 1
 2                                                     y = √2 = 1.4
 3                                                     y = √3 = 1.7
 4                                                     y = √4 = 2
 5                                                     y = √5 = 2.2
 6                                                     y = √6 = 2.4
 7                                                     y = √7 = 2.6
 8                                                     y = √8 = 2.8
 9                                                     y= 9=3


Here is what the graph of this table looks like:


The graphs of square root functions are always curved. The curve above looks like half of a parabola lying
on its side, and in fact it is. It’s half of the parabola that you would get if you graphed the expression
                                  √
y2 = x. And the graph of y = − x is the other half of that parabola:

Notice that if we graph the two separate functions on the same coordinate axes, the combined graph is a
parabola lying on its side.


Now let’s compare square root functions that are multiples of each other.

**Example 2**

                          √           √        √            √
Graph the functions y =       x, y = 2 x, y = 3 x, and y = 4 x on the same graph.

**Solution:**

Here is just the graph without the table of values:


If we multiply the function by a constant bigger than one, the function increases faster the greater the
constant is.


**Example 3**

                          √            √             √                   √
Graph the functions y =       x, y =       2x, y =        3x, and y =         4x on the same graph.

**Solution:**


Notice that multiplying the expression inside the square root by a constant has the same eﬀect as multi-
plying by a constant outside the square root; the function just increases at a slower rate because the entire
function is eﬀectively multiplied by the square root of the constant.
                              √                                   √
Also
√    note that the graph of 4x is the same as the graph of 2 x. This makes sense algebraically since
  4 = 2.

**Example 4**

                          √               √               √                   √
Graph the functions y =       x, y = 12       x, y = 31       x, and y = 14       x on the same graph.

**Solution:**


If we multiply the function by a constant between 0 and 1, the function increases more slowly the smaller
the constant is.

**Example 5**

                         √            √
Graph the functions y = 2 x and y = −2 x on the same graph.

**Solution:**

If we multiply the whole function by -1, the graph is reﬂected about the x−axis.


**Example 6**

                          √                  √
Graph the functions y =       x and y =          −x on the same graph.

**Solution:**


On the other hand,
                 √ when just the x is multiplied by -1, the graph is reﬂected about the y−axis. Notice that
the function y = −x has only negative x−values in its domain, because when x is negative, the expression
under the radical sign is positive.

**Example 7**

                          √            √                   √
Graph the functions y =       x, y =       x + 2 and y =       x − 2.

**Solution:**


When we add a constant to the right-hand side of the equation, the graph keeps the same shape, but shifts

up for a positive constant or down for a negative one.

**Example 8**

                          √            √                    √
Graph the functions y =       x, y =       x − 2, and y =       x + 2.

**Solution:**


When we add a constant to the argument of the function (the part under the radical sign), the function
shifts to the left for a positive constant and to the right for a negative constant.
Now let’s see how to combine all of the above types of transformations.

**Example 9**

                        √
Graph the function y = 2 3x − 1 + 2.

**Solution:**

We can think of this function as a combination of shifts and stretches of the basic square root function
   √
y = x. We know that the graph of that function looks like this:


                                                        √
If we multiply the argument by 3 to √ obtain y =            3x, this stretches the curve vertically because the value
of y increases faster by a factor of 3.
                                                                         √
Next, when we subtract 1 from the argument to obtain y =                     3x − 1 this shifts the entire graph to the left
by one unit.
                                                           √
Multiplying the function by a factor of 2 to obtain y = 2 3x − 1 stretches the curve vertically again,
because y increases faster by a factor of 2.
                                                √
Finally we add 2 to the function to obtain y = 2 3x − 1 + 2. This shifts the entire function vertically by
2 units.


Each step of this process is shown in the graph below. The purple line shows the ﬁnal result.


Now we know how to graph square root functions without making a table of values. If we know what the
basic function looks like, we can use shifts and stretches to transform the function and get to the desired
result.


Solve Real-World Problems Using Square Root Functions
Mathematicians and physicists have studied the motion of pendulums in great detail because this motion
explains many other behaviors that occur in nature. This type of motion is called simple harmonic
motion and it is important because it describes anything that repeats periodically. Galileo was the ﬁrst
person to study the motion of a pendulum, around the year 1600. He found that the time it takes a
pendulum to complete a swing doesn’t depend on its mass or on its angle of swing (as long as the angle of
the swing is small). Rather, it depends only on the length of the pendulum.


The time it takes a pendulum to complete one whole back-and-forth swing is called the period of the
pendulum.
      √    Galileo found that the period of a pendulum is proportional to the square root of its length:
T = a L. The proportionality constant, a, depends on the acceleration of gravity: a = 2π
                                                                                       √ . At sea level
                                                                                        g
on Earth, acceleration of gravity is g = 9.81 m/s2 (meters per second squared). Using this value of gravity,
we ﬁnd a = 2.0 with units of √sm (seconds divided by the square root of meters).


Up until the mid 20th century, all clocks used pendulums as their central time keeping component.

**Example 10**

Graph the period of a pendulum of a clock swinging in a house on Earth at sea level as we change the length
of the pendulum. What does the length of the pendulum need to be for its period to be one second?

**Solution:**

                                                               √
The function for the period of a pendulum at sea level is T = 2 L.
We start by making a table of values for this function:

                                               Table 11.2:
                                                              √
 L                                                      T =2 L
                                                              √
 0                                                      T = 2 √0 = 0
 1                                                      T = 2√ 1 = 2
 2                                                      y = 2 √2 = 2.8
 3                                                      y = 2 √3 = 3.5
 4                                                      y = 2 √4 = 4
 5                                                      y = 2 5 = 4.5


Now let’s graph the function. It makes sense to let the horizontal axis represent the length of the pendulum
and the vertical axis represent the period of the pendulum.


We can see from the graph that a length of approximately 41 meters gives a period of 1 second. We can
conﬁrm this answer by using our function for the period and plugging in T = 1 second:
                                               √           √
                                         T =2 L⇒1=2 L


                   Square both sides of the equation:                     1 = 4L
                   Solve for L :                                          L = meters

gravities than Earth’s.

**Example 11**


“Square” TV screens have an aspect ratio of 4:3; in other words, the width of the screen is 43 the height.
TV “sizes” are traditionally represented as the length of the diagonal of the television screen. Graph the
length of the diagonal of a screen as a function of the area of the screen. What is the diagonal of a screen
with an area of 180 in2 ?

**Solution:**

Let d = length of the diagonal, x = width
Then 4 × height = 3 × width
Or, height = 43 x.


The area of the screen is: A = length × width or A = 34 x2
Find how the diagonal length relates to the width by using the Pythagorean theorem:
                                       ( 3 )2
                                  x + x = d2
                                   x2 + x2 = d 2
                                        25 2             16        4
                                           x = d 2 ⇒ x2 = d 2 ⇒ x = d
                                        16               25        5
                                                                            (     )
                                                                                4 2
Therefore, the diagonal length relates to the area as follows: A = 34           5 d = 4 · 25 d = 25 d .
                                                                                      3 16 2     12 2

                                                                                                                √
We can also ﬂip that around to ﬁnd the diagonal length as a function of the area: d2 = 25
                                                                                       12 A or d =
                                                                                                           √        A.
                                                                                                          2 3
Now we can make a graph where the horizontal axis represents the area of the television screen and the
vertical axis is the length of the diagonal. First let’s make a table of values:

                                               Table 11.3:

                                                                    √
 A                                                     d=      √        A
                                                              2 3
 0                                                     0

From the graph we can estimate that when the area of a TV screen is 180 in2 the length of the diagonal is
approximately 19.5 inches. We√ can conﬁrm
                                       √ this by plugging in A = 180 into the formula that relates the

## 11.2 Radical Expressions


### Learning Objectives

- Use the product and quotient properties of radicals.
- Rationalize the denominator.
- Add and subtract radical expressions.
- Multiply radical expressions.
- Solve real-world problems using square root functions.


Introduction
A radical reverses the operation of raising a number to a power. For example, the square of 4 is 42 = 4 · 4 =
                                                                        √
16, and so the square root of 16 is 4. The symbol for a square root is    . This symbol is also called the
radical sign.
In addition to square roots, we can also take cube roots, fourth roots, and so on. For example, since 64 is
the cube of 4, 4 is the cube root of 64.
                                  √3
                                     64 = 4    since    43 = 4 · 4 · 4 = 64

We put an index number in the top left corner of the radical sign to show which root of the number we
are seeking. Square roots have an index of 2, but we usually don’t bother to write that out.
                                             √2     √
                                                36 = 36 = 6

The cube root of a number gives a number which when raised to the power three gives the number under
the radical sign. The fourth root of number gives a number which when raised to the power four gives the
number under the radical sign:

                                √
                                    81 = 3   since     34 = 3 · 3 · 3 · 3 = 81

And so on for any power we can name.


Even and Odd Roots
Radical expressions that have even indices are called even roots and radical expressions that have odd
indices are called odd roots. There is a very important diﬀerence between even and odd roots, because
they give drastically diﬀerent results when the number inside the radical sign is negative.
Any real number raised to an even power results in a positive answer. Therefore, when the index of a
radical is even, the number inside the radical sign must be non-negative in order to get a real answer.
On the other hand, a positive number raised to an odd power is positive and a negative number raised to
an odd power is negative. Thus, a negative number inside the radical sign is not a problem. It just results
in a negative answer.

**Example 1**

Evaluate each radical expression.
  √
a) 121
   √
b) 125
  √
c) −625

   √
d) −32


**Solution:**

   √
a) 121 = 11
   √
b) 125 = 5
  √
c) −625 is not a real number

   √
d) −32 = −2


Use the Product and Quotient Properties of Radicals
                                                              √
                                                              m                      n
Radicals can be re-written as rational powers. The radical:       an is deﬁned as a m .

**Example 2**

Write each expression as an exponent with a rational value for the exponent.
   √
a) 5
   √
b) 4 a
   √
c) 3 4xy
   √
d) x5

**Solution:**

   √      1
a) 5 = 5 2
   √       1
b) 4 a = a 4

   √             1
c) 3 4xy = (4xy) 3
   √
   6        5
d) x5 = x 6
                                                                                     √n         n
As a result of this property, for any non-negative number a we know that                  an = a n = a.
Since roots of numbers can be treated as powers, we can use exponent rules to simplify and evaluate radical
expressions. Let’s review the product and quotient rule of exponents.

                        Raising a product to a power:                            (x · y)n = xn · yn
                                                                                   ( )n
                                                                                      x     xn
                        Raising a quotient to a power:                                    = n
                                                                                     y      y

In radical notation, these properties are written as
                                                                                 √     √    √
                       Raising a product to a power:                             x·y = mx · my
                                                                                 m

                                                                                 √     √
                                                                                       m
                                                                                   x     x
                       Raising a quotient to a power:                            m
                                                                                     = √
                                                                                   y   m
                                                                                         y

A very important application of these rules is reducing a radical expression to its simplest form. This
means that we apply the root on all the factors of the number that are perfect roots and leave all factors
that are not perfect roots inside the radical sign.
                                 √
For example, in the expression 16, the number 16 is a perfect square because 16 = 42 . This means that
we can simplify it as follows:
                                                         √          √
                                                             16 =       42 = 4

Thus, the square root disappears completely.
                                     √
On the other hand, in the expression 32, the number 32 is not a perfect square, so we can’t just remove
the square root. However, we notice that 32 = 16 · 2, so we can write 32 as the product of a perfect square
and another number. Thus,
                                                         √          √
                                                             32 =       16 · 2

If we apply the “raising a product to a power” rule we get:
                                                   √    √        √    √
                                                    32 = 16 · 2 = 16 · 2
        √                     √              √      √
Since       16 = 4, we get:       32 = 4 ·       2=4 2

**Example 3**

Write the following expressions in the simplest radical form.
  √
a) 8
  √
b) 50
  √
c) 125


**Solution:**

The strategy is to write the number under the square root as the product of a perfect square and another
number. The goal is to ﬁnd the highest perfect square possible; if we don’t ﬁnd it right away, we just
repeat the procedure until we can’t simplify any longer.

                                                                                         √        √
a)                                            We can write 8 = 4 · 2, so                     8=       4 · 2.
                                                                                         √        √
           With the “Raising a product to a power” rule, that becomes                     4 ·         2.
                                               √                                          √
                                     Evaluate 4 and we’re left with                      2 2.

                                                                     √          √
b)                        We can write 50 = 25 · 2, so:                  50 =       25 · 2
                                                                                √         √   √
             Use “Raising a product to a power” rule:                      =        25 · 2 = 5 2

c)                                                                                   √         √
                                                                                         125     125
           Use “Raising a quotient to a power” rule to separate the fraction:                = √
                                                                                          72      72
                                                                                               √          √
                                                                                                 25 · 5  5 5
 Re-write each radical as a product of a perfect square and another number:                  = √        = √
                                                                                                 36 · 2  6 2
The same method can be applied to reduce radicals of diﬀerent indices to their simplest form.

   √
a) 40
   √
b) 4 162

In these cases we look for the highest possible perfect cube, fourth power, etc. as indicated by the index
of the radical.
a)
√   Here√we are √
                looking
                     √  for the
                            √   product of the highest perfect cube and another number. We write:
   40 = 8 · 5 = 8 · 5 = 2 5
 3      3       3     3      3


b) Here we are looking for the product of the highest perfect fourth power and another number.
                                                             √         √
                                                              4 162      162
             Re-write as the quotient of two radicals:              = √ 4
                                                                 80       80
                                                                       √          √     √    √
                                                                         81 · 2     81 · 2

                                                                       4          4      4    4
                                                                                            2 5
                                                                         √
                                                                      3 4 2
      Recombine the fraction under one radical sign:                =
                                                                      2 5

c) Here we are looking for the product of the highest perfect cube root and another number. Often it’s not
very easy to identify the perfect root in the expression under the radical sign. In this case, we can factor
the number under the radical sign completely by using a factor tree:


                                                       √           √
                                                                   3              √
                                                                                  3          √        √
We see that 135 = 3 · 3 · 3 · 5 = 33 · 5. Therefore                    33 · 5 =       33 ·
                                                       3                                     3        3
                                                           135 =                                 5 = 3 5.

Now let’s see some examples involving variables.

as indicated by the index of the radical and another number.

                     Re-write as a product of radicals:                 12x3 y5 = 12 · x3 · y5
                                                       (√    ) (√   ) (√      ) (

                                                                                      √

                                                                                                   4       √4
                                                                   625 · 2 · x4 · x3      5 2 · x · x3
                                                                 4                           4
                                                                                                         5x 2x3
           Simplify each radical separately:                 = √           √           =  √          √ =     √
                                                                                         3 5·y·y · 4y

Recombine fraction under one radical sign:                   = 2
                                                               3y       5y


Add and Subtract Radical Expressions
When we add and subtract radical expressions, we can combine radical terms only when they have the
same expression under the radical sign. This is a lot like combining like terms in variable expressions. For
example,
                                                      √   √   √
                                                     4 2+5 2=9 2
                                                       or
                                    √   √     √      √     √     √
                                   2 3 − 2 + 5 3 + 10 2 = 7 3 + 9 2

It’s important to reduce all radicals to their simplest form in order to √
                                                                         make sure
                                                                               √ that we’re combining
all possible like terms in the expression. For example, the expression 8 − 2 50 looks like it can’t be
simpliﬁed√any more√ because it has no like terms. However, when√we write each radical in its simplest form
we get 2 2 − 10 2, and we can combine those terms to get −8 2.

**Example 6**

    √     √
a) 4 3 + 2 12

**Solution:**

a)                        √                                                     √   √    √   √
             Simplify         12 to its simplest form:                       =4 3+2 4·3=4 3+6 3
                                                                                 √
                                 Combine like terms:                         = 10 3

b)                 √            √                                                    √       √          √     √
        Simplify       24 and       28 to their simplest form:                   = 10 6 · 4 − 7 · 4 = 20 6 − 2 7
                                     There are no like terms.

**Solution:**

a)                                                                         √3       √3           √
                                                                                                 3     √
           Re-write radicals in simplest terms:                         = 4 2 · 64 − 2 · 125 = 16 2 − 5 2
                                                                              √
                                Combine like terms:                     = 11 2

b)                                                                        √            √      √       √
            Re-write radicals in simplest terms:                         3 x2 · x − 12x x = 3x x − 12x x
                                                                                               √
                                 Combine like terms:                                      = −9x x


Multiply Radical Expressions
                                                                                                       √           √ √
When we multiply radical expressions, we use the “raising a product to a power” rule:                  m
                                                                                                           x · y = m x · m y.
In this case we apply this rule in reverse. For example:
                                                √        √        √          √
                                                    6·       8=       6·8=       48

                              √      √         √
Or, in simplest radical form:   48 = 16 · 3 = 4 3.
                                     √ √       √
We’ll also make use of the fact that: a · a = a2 = a.
When we multiply expressions that have numbers on both the outside and inside the radical sign, we treat
the
 √ numbers
       √    outside
              √     the radical sign and the numbers inside the radical sign separately. For example,
a b · c d = ac bd.

**Example 8**

Multiply the following expressions.
    √ (√      √ )
a) 2 3 + 5
     √ ( √      √ )
b) 2 x 3 y − x
   (    √ )(     √ )
c) 2 + 5 2 − 6
   ( √      )(    √ )
d) 2 x + 1 5 − x


**Solution:**

In each case we use distribution to eliminate the parentheses.

         Use the “raising a product to a power” rule:                   = 2·3+ 2·5
                                                                         √   √

                                          Multiply:                 = 6 xy − 2 x2
                                                                        √
                                          Simplify:                 = 6 xy − 2x

            Distribute:            (2 +       5)(2 −       6) = (2 · 2) − 2 · 6 + 2 · 5 − 5 · 6
                                                                      √      √   √

d)                                                ( √     )(  √ )     √           √
                  Distribute:                      2 x − 1 5 − x = 10 x − 2x − 5 + x
                                                                      √
                    Simplify:                                     = 11 x − 2x − 5


Rationalize the Denominator
Often when we work with radicals, we end up with a radical expression in the denominator of a fraction.
It’s traditional to write our fractions in a form that doesn’t have radicals in the denominator, so we use a
process called rationalizing the denominator to eliminate them.
Rationalizing is easiest when there’s just a radical and nothing else in the denominator, as in the fraction
 √2 . All we have to do then is multiply the numerator and denominator by a radical expression that makes
the expression inside the radical√ into a perfect square, cube, or whatever power is appropriate. In the
example above, we multiply by 3:

Cube roots and higher are a little trickier than square roots. For example, how would we rationalize √37 ?
                          √
                                                                        √3
We can’t just multiply by 5, because then the denominator would be 5 .√To make the denominator a
whole number, we need to multiply the numerator and the denominator by 52 :

                                                           =
                                           5     52     53      5

Trickier still is when the expression in the denominator
                                                    √    contains more than one term. For example, consider
                    2√
the expression         . We can’t just multiply by 3, because we’d have to distribute that term and then
                  2+ 3         √
the denominator would be 2 3 + 3.
                               √                                             (     √ )(     √ )
Instead, we multiply by 2 − 3. This is a good choice because the product 2 + 3 2 − 3 is a product
of a sum and a diﬀerence, which means it’s a diﬀerence of squares. The radicals cancel each other out
                                                             (    √ )(    √ )        ( √ )2
when we multiply out, and the denominator works out to 2 + 3 2 − 3 = 22 − 3 = 4 − 3 = 1.
                                                                   √
When we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2 − 3, we get:

                                        √    (   √ )       √

Now consider the expression √ x−2 √y .
                                                                                       √        √
In order to eliminate the radical expressions in the denominator we must multiply by       x + 2 y.

               x−1       x+2 y    ( x−1)( x+2 y)    x−2 y− x+2 xy
We get: √ x−2 √y · √ x+2 √y =     √   √   √   √   =      x−4y

Solve Real-World Problems Using Radical Expressions

Radicals often arise in problems involving areas and volumes of geometrical ﬁgures.

**Example 9**

A pool is twice as long as it is wide and is surrounded by a walkway of uniform width of 1 foot. The
combined area of the pool and the walkway is 400 square feet. Find the dimensions of the pool and the area
of the pool.

**Solution:**

Make a sketch:


Let x = the width of the pool. Then:
Area = length × width
Combined length of pool and walkway = 2x + 2
Combined width of pool and walkway = x + 2
Area = (2x + 2)(x + 2)
Since the combined area of pool and walkway is 400 f t2 we can write the equation
(2x + 2)(x + 2) = 400

     Multiply in order to eliminate the parentheses:         2x2 + 4x + 2x + 4 = 400
                                   Collect like terms:           2x2 + 6x + 4 = 400
         Move all terms to one side of the equation:            2x2 + 6x − 396 = 0
                               Divide all terms by 2:            x2 + 3x − 198 = 0
                                                                                        √
                                                                                 −b ±   b2 − 4ac
                          Use the quadratic formula:                        x=
                                                                                      √2a
                                                                                −3 ± 32 − 4(1)(−198)
                                                                            x=
                                                                                          2(1)
                                                                                      √
                                                                                −3 ± 801       −3 ± 28.3
                                                                            x=              =
                                                                                     2             2
                                                                            x = 12.65 f eet

(The other answer is negative, so we can throw it out because only a positive number makes sense for the
width of a swimming pool.)
Check by plugging the result in the area formula:
Area = (2(12.65) + 2)(12.65 + 2) = 27.3 · 14.65 = 400 f t2 .
The answer checks out.

**Example 10**

The volume of a soda can is 355 cm3 . The height of the can is four times the radius of the base. Find the
radius of the base of the cylinder.

**Solution:**

Make a sketch:


Let x = the radius of the cylinder base. Then the height of the cylinder is 4x.
The volume of a cylinder is given by V = πR2 · h; in this case, R is x and h is 4x, and we know the volume
is 355.
Solve the equation:

                                          355 = πx2 · (4x)
                                          355 = 4πx3
                                           x3 =
                                                √4π
                                                 3 355
                                            x=         = 3.046 cm
                                                    4π

Check by substituting the result back into the formula:

                              V = πR2 · h = π(3.046)2 · (4 · 3.046) = 355 cm3

So the volume is 355 cm3 . The answer checks out.

Introduction
When the variable in an equation appears inside a radical sign, the equation is called a radical equation.
To solve a radical equation, we need to eliminate the radical and change the equation into a polynomial
equation.
A common method for solving radical equations is to isolate the most complicated radical on one side of
the equation and raise both sides of the equation to the power that will eliminate the radical sign. If there
are any radicals left in the equation after simplifying, we can repeat this procedure until all radical signs
are gone. Once the equation is changed into a polynomial equation, we can solve it with the methods we
already know.
We must be careful when we use this method, because whenever we raise an equation to a power, we could
introduce false solutions that are not in fact solutions to the original problem. These are called extraneous
solutions. In order to make sure we get the correct solutions, we must always check all solutions in the
original radical equation.


Solve a Radical Equation
Let’s consider a few simple examples of radical equations where only one radical appears in the equation.


**Example 1**

                                                 √
Find the real solutions of the equation              2x − 1 = 5.

**Solution:**

Since the radical expression is already isolated, we can just square both sides of the equation in order to
eliminate the radical sign:
                                              (√       )2
                                                 2x − 1 = 52

                                   √
               Remember that           a2 = a so the equation simpliﬁes to:                         2x − 1 = 25
                                                        Add one to both sides:                          2x = 26
                                                        Divide both sides by 2:                           x = 13

Finally we need to plug the solution in the original equation to see if it is a valid solution.
√          √             √          √
  2x − 1 = 2(13) − 1 = 26 − 1 = 25 = 5 The solution checks out.

              We isolate the radical on one side of the equation:                                 3 − 7x = 3
                                                                                           (√
                                                                                                      )3
              Raise each side of the equation to the third power:                               3 − 7x = 33
                                                                   Simplify:                        3 − 7x = 27
                                            Subtract 3 from each side:                                −7x = 24
                                                Divide both sides by –7:                                 x=−

       We isolate the radical on one side of the equation:                         10 − x2 = 2 + x
                                                                               (√       )2
                          Square each side of the equation:                      10 − x2 = (2 + x)2
                                                            Simplify:                10 − x2 = 4 + 4x + x2
                Move all terms to one side of the equation:                               0 = 2x2 + 4x − 6
                                                                                                     √

Solve Radical Equations with Radicals on Both Sides
Often equations have more than one radical expression. The strategy in this case is to start by isolating
the most complicated radical expression and raise the equation to the appropriate power. We then repeat
the process until all radical signs are eliminated.

**Example 4**

                                      √              √
Find the real roots of the equation       2x + 1 −       x − 3 = 2.

**Solution:**


                                                                            √              √
               Isolate one of the radical expressions:                        2x + 1 = 2 + x − 3
                                                                         (√       )2 (      √     )2
                                  Square both sides:                        2x + 1 = 2 + x − 3
                                                                                            √
                              Eliminate parentheses:                          2x + 1 = 4 + 4 x − 3 + x − 3
                                                                                         √
                                                 Simplify:                         x=4 x−3
                                                                                       ( √     )2
                  Square both sides of the equation:                              x2 = 4 x − 3
                              Eliminate parentheses:                              x2 = 16(x − 3)
                                                 Simplify:                        x2 = 16x − 48
        Move all terms to one side of the equation:                    x2 − 16x + 48 = 0
                                                  Factor:             (x − 12)(x − 4) = 0
                                                     Solve:                        x = 12 or x = 4


        √          √       √       √
Check: 2(12) + 1 − 12 − 3 = 25 − 9 = 5 − 3 = 2. The solution checks out.
√          √       √   √
 2(4) + 1 − 4 − 3 = 9 − 1 = 3 − 1 = 2 The solution checks out.
The equation has two solutions: x = 12 and x = 4.


Identify Extraneous Solutions to Radical Equations
We saw in Example 3 that some of the solutions that we ﬁnd by solving radical equations do not check out
when we substitute (or “plug in”) those solutions back into the original radical equation. These are called
extraneous solutions. It is very important to check the answers we obtain by plugging them back into
the original equation, so we can tell which of them are real solutions.

**Example 5**

**Solution:**


                                                                          √     √
              Isolate one of the radical expressions:                     x−3= x+1
                                                                      (√    )2 ( √      )2
                                      Square both sides:                 x−3 =     x+1
                                                                                ( √ )2     √
                                    Remove parenthesis:                   x−3=     x +2 x+1
                                                                                      √
                                                    Simplify:             x−3= x+2 x+1
                                                                                  √
                 Now isolate the remaining radical:                        −4 = 2 x
                                                                                √
                                   Divide all terms by 2:                  −2 = x
                                      Square both sides:                      x=4


         √          √        √
Check:       4−3−       4=       1 − 2 = 1 − 2 = −1 The solution does not check out.
The equation has no real solutions. x = 4 is an extraneous solution.


Solve Real-World Problems using Radical Equations
Radical equations often appear in problems involving areas and volumes of objects.

**Example 6**

Anita’s square vegetable garden is 21 square feet larger than Fred’s square vegetable garden. Anita and Fred
decide to pool their money together and buy the same kind of fencing for their gardens. If they need 84 feet
of fencing, what is the size of each garden?

**Solution:**

Make a sketch:


Deﬁne variables: Let Fred’s area be x; then Anita’s area is x + 21.
Find an equation:
                                      √
Side length of Fred’s garden is        x
                                       √
Side length of Anita’s garden is           x + 21
The amount of fencing is equal to the combined perimeters of the two squares:


                                                     √     √
                                                    4 x + 4 x + 21 = 84


Solve the equation:

                                                                   √        √
                              Divide all terms by 4:                   x+       x + 21 = 21
                                                                            √             √
             Isolate one of the radical expressions:                        x + 21 = 21 − x
                                                                       (√       )2 (       √ )2
                                 Square both sides:                       x + 21 = 21 − x
                                                                                             √
                             Eliminate parentheses:                         x + 21 = 441 − 42 x + x
                                                                               √
                     Isolate the radical expression:                         42 x = 420
                                                                               √
                           Divide both sides by 42:                              x = 10
                                 Square both sides:                                 x = 100 f t2
        √       √
Check: 4 100 + 4 100 + 21 = 40 + 44 = 84. The solution checks out.
Fred’s garden is 10 f t × 10 f t = 100 f t2 and Anita’s garden is 11 f t × 11 f t = 121 f t2 .

**Example 7**

A sphere has a volume of 456 cm3 . If the radius of the sphere is increased by 2 cm, what is the new volume
of the sphere?

**Solution:**

Make a sketch:


Deﬁne variables: Let R = the radius of the sphere.
Find an equation: The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = 43 πR3 .
Solve the equation:
                  Plug in the value of the volume:                   456 = πR3
                                      Multiply by 3:                1368 = 4πR3
                                      Divide by 4π :              108.92 = R3
                                                                           √3
                   Take the cube root of each side:                    R = 108.92 ⇒ R = 4.776 cm
            The new radius is 2 centimeters more:                       R = 6.776 cm
                                The new volume is:                      V = π(6.776)3 = 1302.5 cm3

Check: Let’s plug in the values of the radius into the volume formula:
V = 43 πR3 = 43 π(4.776)3 = 456 cm3 . The solution checks out.

**Example 8**

The kinetic energy of an object of mass m and velocity v is given by the formula: KE = 12 mv2 . A baseball
has a mass of 145 kg and its kinetic energy is measured to be 654 Joules (kg · m2 /s2 ) when it hits the
catcher’s glove. What is the velocity of the ball when it hits the catcher’s glove?


**Solution:**

                                    Start with the formula:             KE = mv2
                                                                    kg · m  2   1
    Plug in the values for the mass and the kinetic energy:     654     2
                                                                              = (145 kg)v2
                                                                      s         2
                                                                    kg · m  2
                                  Multiply both sides by 2:    1308           = 145 kg · v2
                                                                      s2
                                                                         m2
                              Divide both sides by 145 kg :        9.02 2 = v2
                                                                          s           √
                                                                                √         m2
                        Take the square root of both sides:                 v = 9.02         = 3.003 m/s
                                                                                          s2

Check: Plug the values for the mass and the velocity into the energy formula:
                               1     1
                           KE = mv2 = (145 kg)(3.003 m/s)2 = 654 kg · m2 /s2

Introduction
Teresa wants to string a clothesline across her backyard, from one corner to the opposite corner. If the
yard measures 22 feet by 34 feet, how many feet of clothesline does she need?
The Pythagorean Theorem is a statement of how the lengths of the sides of a right triangle are related
to each other. A right triangle is one that contains a 90 degree angle. The side of the triangle opposite
the 90 degree angle is called the hypotenuse and the sides of the triangle adjacent to the 90 degree angle
are called the legs.


If we let a and b represent the legs of the right triangle and c represent the hypotenuse then the Pythagorean
Theorem can be stated as:

In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the
lengths of the legs. That is: a2 + b2 = c2 .
This theorem is very useful because if we know the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, we can ﬁnd the
length of the hypotenuse. Also, if we know the length of the hypotenuse and the length of a leg, we can
calculate the length of the missing leg of the triangle. When you use the Pythagorean Theorem, it does
not matter which leg you call a and which leg you call b, but the hypotenuse is always called c.
Although nowadays we use the Pythagorean Theorem as a statement about the relationship between
distances and lengths, originally the theorem made a statement about areas. If we build squares on each
side of a right triangle, the Pythagorean Theorem says that the area of the square whose side is the
hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares formed by the legs of the triangle.


Use the Pythagorean Theorem and Its Converse
The Pythagorean Theorem can be used to verify that a triangle is a right triangle. If you can show that
the three sides of a triangle make the equation a2 + b2 = c2 true, then you know that the triangle is a right
triangle. This is called the Converse of the Pythagorean Theorem.
Note: When you use the Converse of the Pythagorean Theorem, you must make sure that you substitute
the correct values for the legs and the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse must be the longest side. The other
two sides are the legs, and the order in which you use them is not important.

**Example 1**

Determine if a triangle with sides 5, 12 and 13 is a right triangle.

**Solution:**

The triangle is right if its sides satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem.
If it is a right triangle, the longest side has to be the hypotenuse, so we let c = 13.
We then designate the shorter sides as a = 5 and b = 12.
We plug these values into the Pythagorean Theorem:

                                                  a2 + b2 = c2 ⇒ 52 + 122 = c2
                                      25 + 144 = 169 = c2 ⇒ c = 13

The sides of the triangle satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem, thus the triangle is a right triangle.

**Example 2**

                                       √         √
Determine if a triangle with sides,        10,    15 and 5 is a right triangle.

**Solution:**

The longest side has to be the hypotenuse, so c = 5.

                                        √                √
We designate the shorter sides as a =       10 and b =    15.
We plug these values into the Pythagorean Theorem:

                                                         (√        )2       (√        )2
                                     a2 + b2 = c2 ⇒           10        +        15        = c2
                               10 + 15 = 25 = c2 ⇒ c = 5


The sides of the triangle satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem, thus the triangle is a right triangle.
The Pythagorean Theorem can also be used to ﬁnd the missing hypotenuse of a right triangle if we know the
legs of the triangle. (For a demonstration of this, see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HYHG3fuzvk .)

**Example 3**

In a right triangle one leg has length 4 and the other has length 3. Find the length of the hypotenuse.

**Solution:**


                  Start with the Pythagorean Theorem:                                             a2 + b2 = c2
                   Plug in the known values of the legs:                                          32 + 42 = c2
                                                  Simplify:                                       9 + 16 = c2
                                                                                                      25 = c2
                     Take the square root of both sides:                                                c=5

**Solution:**

Apply the Pythagorean Theorem.
a)
                                   a2 + b2 = c2
                                  x2 + 152 = 212
                                  x2 + 225 = 441
                                        x2 = 216 ⇒
                                             √      √
                                         x = 216 = 6 6

b)
                                  a2 + b2 = c2
                                  y2 + 32 = 72
                                   y2 + 9 = 49
                                       y2 = 40 ⇒
                                            √     √
                                        y = 40 = 2 10

                                   a2 + b2 = c2
                                 182 + 152 = z2
                                 324 + 225 = z
                                        z2 = 549 ⇒
                                             √      √
                                         z = 549 = 3 61


**Example 5**


One leg of a right triangle is 5 units longer than the other leg. The hypotenuse is one unit longer than
twice the size of the short leg. Find the dimensions of the triangle.

**Solution:**

Let x = length of the short leg.
Then x + 5 = length of the long leg
And 2x + 1 = length of the hypotenuse.
The sides of the triangle must satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem.

                                                Therefore:        x2 + (x + 5)2 = (2x + 1)2
                              Eliminate the parentheses: x2 + x2 + 10x + 25 = 4x2 + 4x + 1
  Move all terms to the right hand side of the equation:                     0 = 2x2 − 6x − 24
                                   Divide all terms by 2 :                   0 = x2 − 3x − 12
                                                                                     √               √
                                                                                 3 ± 9 + 48      3 ± 57
                      Solve using the quadratic formula:                     x=               =
                                                                                       2            2
                                                                             x = 5.27 or x = −2.27

The negative solution doesn’t make sense when we are looking for a physical distance, so we can discard
it. Using the positive solution, we get: short leg = 5.27, long leg = 10.27 and hypotenuse = 11.54.


Solve Real-World Problems Using the Pythagorean Theorem and
Its Converse
The Pythagorean Theorem and its converse have many applications for ﬁnding lengths and distances.

**Example 6**

Maria has a rectangular cookie sheet that measures 10 inches × 14 inches. Find the length of the diagonal
of the cookie sheet.

**Solution:**

Draw a sketch:


Deﬁne variables: Let c = length of the diagonal.
Write a formula: Use the Pythagorean Theorem: a2 + b2 = c2
Solve the equation:

                          102 + 142 = c2
                          100 + 196 = c2
                                            √              √
                           c2 = 296 ⇒ c =       296 ⇒ c = 2 74 or c = 17.2 inches

Check: 102 + 142 = 100 + 196 = 296 and c2 = 17.22 = 296. The solution checks out.

**Example 7**

Find the area of the shaded region in the following diagram:


**Solution:**

Draw the diagonal of the square in the ﬁgure:


Notice that the diagonal of the square is also the diameter of the circle.
Deﬁne variables: Let c = diameter of the circle.
Write the formula: Use the Pythagorean Theorem: a2 + b2 = c2 .
Solve the equation:


                                       22 + 22 = c2
                                         4 + 4 = c2
                                                       √        √
                                        c2 = 8 ⇒ c =       8⇒c=2 2


                               √                           √
The diameter of the circle is 2 2, therefore the radius R = 2.
                                        ( √ )2
Area of a circle formula: A = π · R2 = π 2 = 2π.
The area of the shaded region is therefore 2π − 4 = 2.28.

**Example 8**

In a right triangle, one leg is twice as long as the other and the perimeter is 28. What are the measures of
the sides of the triangle?

**Solution:**

Make a sketch and deﬁne variables:

Let: a = length of the short leg
2a = length of the long leg
c = length of the hypotenuse
Write formulas:
The sides of the triangle are related in two diﬀerent ways.
The perimeter is 28, so a + 2a + c = 28 ⇒ 3a + c = 28
The triangle is a right triangle, so the measures of the sides must satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem:

                                      a2 + (2a)2 = c2 ⇒ a2 + 4a2 = c2 ⇒ 5a2 = c2
                                           √
                             or       c = a 5 = 2.236a

Solve the equation:
Plug the value of c we just obtained into the perimeter equation: 3a + c = 28

                                  3a + 2.236a = 28 ⇒ 5.236a = 28 ⇒ a = 5.35

The short leg is: a = 5.35
The long leg is: 2a = 10.70
The hypotenuse is: c = 11.95
Check: The legs of the triangle should satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem:
a2 + b2 = 5.352 + 10.702 = 143.1, c2 = 11.952 = 142.80. The results are approximately the same.
The perimeter of the triangle should be 28:
a + b + c = 5.35 + 10.70 + 11.95 = 28 The answer checks out.

**Example 9**

Mike is loading a moving van by walking up a ramp. The ramp is 10 feet long and the bed of the van is 2.5
feet above the ground. How far does the ramp extend past the back of the van?

**Solution:**

Make a sketch:


Deﬁne variables: Let x = how far the ramp extends past the back of the van.
Write a formula: Use the Pythagorean Theorem: x2 + 2.52 = 102

Solve the equation:

                                          x2 + 6.25 = 100
                                                  x2 = 93.5
                                                       √
                                                   x = 93.5 = 9.7 f t

Check by plugging the result in the Pythagorean Theorem:
9.72 + 2.52 = 94.09 + 6.25 = 100.34 ≈ 100. So the ramp is 10 feet long. The answer checks out.

Introduction
In the last section, we saw how to use the Pythagorean Theorem to ﬁnd lengths. In this section, you’ll
learn how to use the Pythagorean Theorem to ﬁnd the distance between two coordinate points.

**Example 1**

Find the distance between points A = (1, 4) and B = (5, 2).

**Solution:**

Plot the two points on the coordinate plane.
In order to get from point A = (1, 4) to point B = (5, 2), we need to move 4 units to the right and 2 units
down. These lines make the legs of a right triangle.
To ﬁnd the distance between A and B we ﬁnd the value of the hypotenuse, d, using the Pythagorean
Theorem.
                                         d2 = 22 + 42 = 20
                                              √        √
                                          d = 20 = 2 5 = 4.47


**Example 2**

Find the distance between points C = (2, −1) and D = (−3, −4).

**Solution:**

We plot the two points on the graph above.
In order to get from point C to point D, we need to move 3 units down and 5 units to the left.
We ﬁnd the distance from C to D by ﬁnding the length of d with the Pythagorean Theorem.
                                             d2 = 32 + 52 = 34
                                                  √
                                              d = 34 = 5.83


The Distance Formula
The procedure we just used can be generalized by using the Pythagorean Theorem to derive a formula for
the distance between any two points on the coordinate plane.

Let’s ﬁnd the distance between two general points A = (x1 , y1 ) and B = (x2 , y2 ).
Start by plotting the points on the coordinate plane:


In order to move from point A to point B in the coordinate plane, we move x2 − x1 units to the right and
y2 − y1 units up.
We can ﬁnd the length d by using the Pythagorean Theorem:

                                          d2 = (x1 − x2 )2 + (y1 − y2 )2
                 √
Therefore, d =  (x1 − x2 )2 + (y1 − y2 )2 . This is called the Distance Formula. More formally:
                                                                                √
Given any two points (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ), the distance between them is d = (x1 − x2 )2 + (y1 − y2 )2 .
We can use this formula to ﬁnd the distance between any two points on the coordinate plane. Notice that
the distance is the same whether you are going from point A to point B or from point B to point A, so it
does not matter which order you plug the points into the distance formula.
Let’s now apply the distance formula to the following examples.

**Example 2**

Find the distance between the following points.
a) (-3, 5) and (4, -2)
b) (12, 16) and (19, 21)
c) (11.5, 2.3) and (-4.2, -3.9)

**Solution:**

Plug the values of the two points into the distance formula. Be sure to simplify if possible.
       √                           √                 √           √        √
a) d = (−3 − 4)2 + (5 − (−2))2 = (−7)2 + (7)2 = 49 + 49 = 98 = 7 2
       √                           √                   √          √
b) d = (12 − 19)2 + (16 − 21)2 = (−7)2 + (−5)2 = 49 + 25 = 74
       √                               √                   √
c) d = (11.5 + 4.2)2 + (2.3 + 3.9)2 = (15.7)2 + (6.2)2 = 284.93 = 16.88
We can also use the Pythagorean Theorem

**Example 3**

Find all points on the line y = 2 that are exactly 8 units away from the point (-3, 7).

**Solution:**

Let’s make a sketch of the given situation.
Draw line segments from the point (-3, 7) to the line y = 2.

Let k be the missing value of x we are seeking.


                                                               √
              Let’s use the distance formula:             8=       (−3 − k)2 + (7 − 2)2
           Square both sides of the equation:            64 = (−3 − k)2 + 25
                                   Therefore:             0 = 9 + 6k + k2 − 39 or 0 = k2 + 6k − 30
                                                                    √                   √
                                                              −6 ± 36 + 120       −6 ± 156
                  Use the quadratic formula:              k=                   =
                                                                      2                2
                                   Therefore:             k = 3.24 or k = −9.24

The points are (-9.24, 2) and (3.24, 2).


Find the Midpoint of a Line Segment

**Example 4**

Find the coordinates of the point that is in the middle of the line segment connecting the points A = (−7, −2)
and B = (3, −8).

**Solution:**

Let’s start by graphing the two points:


We see that to get from point A to point B we move 6 units down and 10 units to the right.
In order to get to the point that is halfway between the two points, it makes sense that we should move
half the vertical distance and half the horizontal distance—that is, 3 units down and 5 units to the right
from point A.

The midpoint is M = (−7 + 5, −2 − 3) = (−2, −5).
The Midpoint Formula
We now want to generalize this method in order to ﬁnd a formula for the midpoint of a line segment.
Let’s take two general points A = (x1 , y1 ) and B = (x2 , y2 ) and mark them on the coordinate plane:


We see that to get from A to B, we move x2 − x1 units to the right and y2 − y1 units up.
In order to get to the half-way
                             ( point,       we need to )move x2 −x
                                                                     units to the right and y2 −y
                                                                                                    up from point A.
                                     x2 −x1       y2 −y1
Thus the midpoint M is at x1 + 2 , y1 + 2 .
                        (               )
                              2 y1 +y2
This simpliﬁes to M = x1 +x2   ,   2     . This is the Midpoint Formula:
                                                                                       (             )
                                                                                            2 y1 +y2
The midpoint of the line segment connecting the points (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ) is x1 +x 2 , 2        .
It should hopefully make sense that the midpoint of a line is found by taking the average values of the x
and y−values of the endpoints.

Let’s apply the Midpoint Formula:        1

a) the midpoint of (-10, 2) and (3, 5) is −10+32   , 2+5

                                                                  ,
                                                               2 2 = (−3.5, 3.5)

                                                 −5+5
c) the midpoint of (4, -5) and (-4, 5) is 4−42 , 2      = 02 , 20 = (0, 0)


**Example 6**

A line segment whose midpoint is (2, -6) has an endpoint of (9, -2). What is the other endpoint?

**Solution:**

In this problem we know the midpoint and we are looking for the missing endpoint.
The midpoint is (2, -6).
One endpoint is (x1 , x2 ) = (9, −2).
Let’s call the missing point (x, y).
We know that the x−coordinate of the midpoint is 2, so: 2 = 9+x
                                                             2 ⇒ 4 = 9 + x2 ⇒ x2 = −5


We know that the y−coordinate of the midpoint is -6, so:
                                         −2 + y2
                                  −6 =           ⇒ −12 = −2 + y2 ⇒ y2 = −10

The missing endpoint is (-5, -10).
Here’s another way to look at this problem: To get from the endpoint (9, -2) to the midpoint (2, �6), we
had to go 7 units left and 4 units down. To get from the midpoint to the other endpoint, then, we would
need to go 7 more units left and 4 more units down, which takes us to (-5, -10).


Solve Real-World Problems Using Distance and Midpoint For-
mulas
The distance and midpoint formula are useful in geometry situations where we want to ﬁnd the distance
between two points or the point halfway between two points.

**Example 7**

Plot the points A = (4, −2), B = (5, 5), and C = (−1, 3) and connect them to make a triangle. Show that the
triangle is isosceles.

**Solution:**

Let’s start by plotting the three points on the coordinate plane and making a triangle:


We use the distance formula three times to ﬁnd the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.
                       √                      √                   √           √        √
                AB = (4 − 5)2 + (−2 − 5)2 = (−1)2 + (−7)2 = 1 + 49 = 50 = 5 2
                       √                     √                √          √        √
                BC = (5 + 1)2 + (5 − 3)2 = (6)2 + (2)2 = 36 + 4 = 40 = 2 10
                       √                      √                 √             √        √
                AC = (4 + 1)2 + (−2 − 3)2 = (5)2 + (−5)2 = 25 + 25 = 50 = 5 2

Notice that AB = AC, therefore triangle ABC is isosceles.

**Example 8**

At 8 AM one day, Amir decides to walk in a straight line on the beach. After two hours of making no turns
and traveling at a steady rate, Amir is two miles east and four miles north of his starting point. How far
did Amir walk and what was his walking speed?

**Solution:**

Let’s start by plotting Amir’s route on a coordinate graph. We can place his starting point at the origin:
A = (0, 0). Then his ending point will be at B = (2, 4).


The distance can be found with the distance formula:
                          √                      √           √        √
                      d = (2 − 0)2 + (4 − 0)2 = (2)2 + (4)2 = 4 + 16 = 20
                        d = 4.47 miles

Since Amir walked 4.47 miles in 2 hours, his speed is s = 4.47 miles
                                                           2 hours = 2.24 mi/h.

### Learning Objectives

- Distinguish direct and inverse variation.
- Graph inverse variation equations.
- Write inverse variation equations.
- Solve real-world problems using inverse variation equations.


Introduction
Many variables in real-world problems are related to each other by variations. A variation is an equation
that relates a variable to one or more other variables by the operations of multiplication and division.
There are three diﬀerent kinds of variation: direct variation, inverse variation and joint variation.


Distinguish Direct and Inverse Variation
In direct variation relationships, the related variables will either increase together or decrease together
at a steady rate. For instance, consider a person walking at three miles per hour. As time increases, the
distance covered by the person walking also increases, at the rate of three miles each hour. The distance
and time are related to each other by a direct variation:

                                          distance = speed × time

Since the speed is a constant 3 miles per hour, we can write: d = 3t.
The general equation for a direct variation is y = kx, where k is called the constant of proportionality.
You can see from the equation that a direct variation is a linear equation with a y−intercept of zero. The
graph of a direct variation relationship is a straight line passing through the origin whose slope is k, the
constant of proportionality.

A second type of variation is inverse variation. When two quantities are related to each other inversely,
one quantity increases as the other one decreases, and vice versa.
For instance, if we look at the formula distance = speed × time again and solve for time, we obtain:
                                                       distance
                                              time =
                                                        speed

If we keep the distance constant, we see that as the speed of an object increases, then the time it takes to
cover that distance decreases. Consider a car traveling a distance of 90 miles, then the formula relating
time and speed is: t = 90
                        s .
The general equation for inverse variation is y = kx , where k is the constant of proportionality.
In this chapter, we’ll investigate how the graphs of these relationships behave.
Another type of variation is a joint variation. In this type of relationship, one variable may vary as a
product of two or more variables.
For example, the volume of a cylinder is given by:

                                                 V = πR2 · h

In this example the volume varies directly as the product of the square of the radius of the base and the
height of the cylinder. The constant of proportionality here is the number π.
In many application problems, the relationship between the variables is a combination of variations. For
instance Newton’s Law of Gravitation states that the force of attraction between two spherical bodies
varies jointly as the masses of the objects and inversely as the square of the distance between them:
                                                       m1 m2
                                                F =G
                                                        d2

In this example the constant of proportionality is called the gravitational constant, and its value is given
by G = 6.673 × 10−11 N · m2 /kg2 .


Graph Inverse Variation Equations
We saw that the general equation for inverse variation is given by the formula y = kx , where k is a constant
of proportionality. We will now show how the graphs of such relationships behave. We start by making a
table of values. In most applications, x and y are positive, so in our table we’ll choose only positive values
of x.


**Example 1**

Graph an inverse variation relationship with the proportionality constant k = 1.

**Solution:**

                                               Table 12.1:

 x                                                     y = 1x
 0                                                     y = 10 = undeﬁned
 4                                                     y = 11 = 4
 2                                                     y = 11 = 2
 4                                                     y = 13 = 1.33
 1                                                     y = 11 = 1
 2                                                     y = 13 = 0.67
 2                                                     y = 12 = 0.5
 3                                                     y = 13 = 0.33
 4                                                     y = 14 = 0.25
 5                                                     y = 15 = 0.2
 10                                                    y = 10  = 0.1


Here is a graph showing these points connected with a smooth curve.


Both the table and the graph demonstrate the relationship between variables in an inverse variation. As
one variable increases, the other variable decreases and vice versa.
Notice that when x = 0, the value of y is undeﬁned. The graph shows that when the value of x is very
small, the value of y is very big—so it approaches inﬁnity as x gets closer and closer to zero.
Similarly, as the value of x gets very large, the value of y gets smaller and smaller but never reaches zero.
We will investigate this behavior in detail throughout this chapter.


Write Inverse Variation Equations
As we saw, an inverse variation fulﬁlls the equation y = kx . In general, we need to know the value of y at
a particular value of x in order to ﬁnd the proportionality constant. Once we know the proportionality
constant, we can then ﬁnd the value of y for any given value of x.


**Example 2**

If y is inversely proportional to x, and if y = 10 when x = 5, ﬁnd y when x = 2.

**Solution:**

Since y is inversely proportional to x, then:                  y = kx

Plug in the values y = 10 and x = 5 :                          10 = 5k

Solve for k by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5 :    k = 50

The inverse relationship is given by:                          y = 50
                                                                    x

When x = 2 :                                                    y = 50
                                                                    2 or y = 25

**Example 3**

If p is inversely proportional to the square of q, and p = 64 when q = 3, ﬁnd p when q = 5.

**Solution:**

Since p is inversely proportional to q2 , then:                   p = qk2

Plug in the values p = 64 and q = 3 :                              64 = 3k2 or 64 = 9k

Solve for k by multiplying both sides of the equation by 9 :       k = 576

The inverse relationship is given by:                              p = 576
                                                                        q2

When q = 5 :                                                       p = 576
                                                                        25 or y = 23.04

Many formulas in physics are described by variations. In this section we’ll investigate some problems that
are described by inverse variations.

**Example 4**

The frequency, f , of sound varies inversely with wavelength, λ. A sound signal that has a wavelength of
34 meters has a frequency of 10 hertz. What frequency does a sound signal of 120 meters have?


**Solution:**

The inverse variation relationship is:            f = λk

Plug in the values: λ = 34 and f = 10 :                k
                                                 10 = 34

Multiply both sides by 34 :                      k = 340

Thus, the relationship is given by:              f = 340
                                                      λ

Plug in λ = 120 meters:                               120 ⇒ f = 2.83 Hertz
                                                  f = 340

**Example 5**

Electrostatic force is the force of attraction or repulsion between two charges. The electrostatic force is given
by the formula F = Kqd12q2 , where q1 and q2 are the charges of the charged particles, d is the distance between
the charges and k is a proportionality constant. The charges do not change, so they too are constants; that
means we can combine them with the other constant k to form a new constant K, so we can rewrite the
equation as F = dK2 .
If the electrostatic force is F = 740 Newtons when the distance between charges is 5.3 × 10−11 meters, what
is F when d = 2.0 × 10−10 meters?

**Solution:**

The inverse variation relationship is:                     F = dK2

Plug in the values F = 740 and d = 5.3 × 10−11 :            740 =          K
                                                                     (5.3 × 10−11 )2
                                                                   (            )2
Multiply both sides by (5.3 × 10−11 )2 :                    K = 740 5.3 × 10−11

                                                            K = 2.08 × 10−18
                                                                           −18
The electrostatic force is given by:                       F = 2.08 ×d210
                                                                             −18
When d = 2.0 × 10−10 :                                      F = 2.08 × 10−10 2
                                                                 (2.0 × 10       )

Use scientiﬁc notation to simplify:                        F = 52 Newtons

## 12.2 Graphs of Rational Functions


### Learning Objectives

- Compare graphs of inverse variation equations.
- Graph rational functions.
- Solve real-world problems using rational functions.


Introduction
In this section, you’ll learn how to graph rational functions. Graphs of rational functions are very dis-
tinctive, because they get closer and closer to certain values but never reach those values. This behavior
is called asymptotic behavior, and we will see that rational functions can have horizontal asymptotes,
vertical asymptotes or oblique (or slant) asymptotes.

Compare Graphs of Inverse Variation Equations
Inverse variation problems are the simplest example of rational functions. We saw that an inverse variation
has the general equation: y = kx . In most real-world problems, x and y take only positive values. Below,
we will show graphs of three inverse variation functions.

**Example 1**

On the same coordinate grid, graph inverse variation relationships with the proportionality constants k =
1, k = 2, and k = 21 .

**Solution:**

We’ll skip the table of values for this problem, and just show the graphs of the three functions on the same
coordinate axes. Notice that for larger constants of proportionality, the curve decreases at a slower rate
than for smaller constants of proportionality. This makes sense because the value of y is related directly
to the proportionality constants, so we should expect larger values of y for larger values of k.


Graph Rational Functions
Now we’ll extend the domain and range of rational equations to include negative values of x and y. First
we’ll plot a few rational functions by using a table of values, and then we’ll talk about the distinguishing
characteristics of rational functions that can help us make better graphs.
As we graph rational functions, we need to always pay attention to values of x that will cause us to divide
by 0. Remember that dividing by 0 doesn’t give us an actual number as a result.

**Example 2**

Graph the function y = 1x .

**Solution:**

Before we make a table of values, we should notice that the function is not deﬁned for x = 0. This means
that the graph of the function won’t have a value at that point. Since the value of x = 0 is special, we
should make sure to pick enough values close to x = 0 in order to get a good idea how the graph behaves.
Let’s make two tables: one for x−values smaller than zero and one for x−values larger than zero.

                                               Table 12.2:

 x                            y = 1x                   x                          y = 1x
 −5                               1
                              y = −5 = −0.2            0.1                             1
                                                                                  y = 0.1 = 10

                                                                                    y = 0.4 = 2.5

                                                                                    y = 0.5 =2

                                                                                    y= 1 =1
 -0.4                        y = −0.4 = −2.5
                                                        2                           y = 12 = 0.5
 -0.3                             1
                             y = −0.3 = −3.3            3                           y = 13 = 0.33
 -0.2                        y = −0.2 = −5
                                                        4                           y = 14 = 0.25
 -0.1                             1
                             y = −0.1 = −10             5                           y = 15 = 0.2


We can see that as we pick positive values of x closer and closer to zero, y gets larger, and as we pick
negative values of x closer and closer to zero, y gets smaller (or more and more negative).


Notice on the graph that for values of x near 0, the points on the graph get closer and closer to the vertical
line x = 0. The line x = 0 is called a vertical asymptote of the function y = 1x .
We also notice that as the absolute values of x get larger in the positive direction or in the negative
direction, the value of y gets closer and closer to y = 0 but will never gain that value. Since y = 1x , we can
see that there are no values of x that will give us the value y = 0. The horizontal line y = 0 is called a
horizontal asymptote of the function y = 1x


Asymptotes are usually denoted as dashed lines on a graph. They are not part of the function; instead,
they show values that the function approaches, but never gets to. A horizontal asymptote shows the value
of y that the function approaches (but never reaches) as the absolute value of x gets larger and larger. A

vertical asymptote shows that the absolute value of y gets larger and larger as x gets closer to a certain
value which it can never actually reach.
Now we’ll show the graph of a rational function that has a vertical asymptote at a non-zero value of x.

**Example 3**

Graph the function y = (x−2) 2.


**Solution:**

We can see that the function is not deﬁned for x = 2, because that would make the denominator of the
fraction equal zero. This tells us that there should be a vertical asymptote at x = 2, so we can start
graphing the function by drawing the vertical asymptote.


Now let’s make a table of values.
                                              Table 12.3:

 x                                                    y = (x−2) 2

                                                             1       1
 0                                                    y = (0−2) 2 = 4
 1                                                    y = (1−2) 2 = 1
 1.5                                                  y = (1.5−2)2 = 4
 2                                                    undeﬁned
 2.5                                                  y = (2.5−2) 2 = 4
 3                                                    y = (3−2)2 = 1
                                                             1       1
 4                                                    y = (4−2) 2 = 4


Here’s the resulting graph:

Notice that we didn’t pick as many values for our table this time, because by now we have a pretty good
idea what happens near the vertical asymptote.
We also know that for large values of |x|, the value of y could approach a constant value. In this case that
value is y = 0: this is the horizontal asymptote.
A rational function doesn’t have to have a vertical or horizontal asymptote. The next example shows a
rational function with no vertical asymptotes.

**Example 4**

Graph the function y = x2x+1 .

**Solution:**

We can see that this function will have no vertical asymptotes because the denominator of the fraction will
never be zero. Let’s make a table of values to see if the value of y approaches a particular value for large
values of x, both positive and negative.

                                               Table 12.4:
 x                                                     y = x2x+1
                                                             (−3)2
 −3                                                                   9
                                                       y = (−3)2 +1 = 10 = 0.9
                                                             (−2)2
 -2                                                    y = (−2)2 +1 = 45 = 0.8
                                                             (−1)2
 -1                                                    y = (−1)2 +1 = 12 = 0.5
                                                             (0)2

                                                             (1)2
 1                                                     y = (1)2 +1 = 12 = 0.5
                                                             (2)2
 2                                                     y = (2)2 +1 = 45 = 0.8
                                                             (3)2     9
 3                                                     y = (3)2 +1 = 10 = 0.9


Below is the graph of this function.

The function has no vertical asymptote. However, we can see that as the values of |x| get larger, the value
of y gets closer and closer to 1, so the function has a horizontal asymptote at y = 1.


Finding Horizontal Asymptotes
We said that a horizontal asymptote is the value of y that the function approaches for large values of |x|.
When we plug in large values of x in our function, higher powers of x get larger much quickly than lower
powers of x. For example, consider:
                                                   2x2 + x − 1
                                              y=
                                                   3x2 − 4x + 3

If we plug in a large value of x, say x = 100, we get:
                                      2(100)2 + (100) − 1   20000 + 100 − 1
                                y=                        =
                                     3(100)2 − 4(100) + 3   30000 − 400 + 2

We can see that the beginning terms in the numerator and denominator are much bigger than the other
terms in each expression. One way to ﬁnd the horizontal asymptote of a rational function is to ignore all
terms in the numerator and denominator except for the highest powers.
In this example the horizontal asymptote is y = 2x
                                                3x2
                                                    , which simpliﬁes to y = 23 .
In the function above, the highest power of x was the same in the numerator as in the denominator. Now
consider a function where the power in the numerator is less than the power in the denominator:
                                                          x
                                                 y=
                                                        x2 + 3

As before, we ignore all the terms except the highest power of x in the numerator and the denominator.
That gives us y = xx2 , which simpliﬁes to y = 1x .
For large values of x, the value of y gets closer and closer to zero. Therefore the horizontal asymptote is
y = 0.
To summarize:

- Find vertical asymptotes by setting the denominator equal to zero and solving for x.
- For horizontal asymptotes, we must consider several cases:
        – If the highest power of x in the numerator is less than the highest power of x in the denominator,
          then the horizontal asymptote is at y = 0.

         – If the highest power of x in the numerator is the same as the highest power of x in the denomi-
           nator, then the horizontal asymptote is at y = coe  f f icient o f highest power o f x
                                                           coe f f icient o f highest power o f x .
         – If the highest power of x in the numerator is greater than the highest power of x in the de-
           nominator, then we don’t have a horizontal asymptote; we could have what is called an oblique
           (slant) asymptote, or no asymptote at all.


**Example 5**

Find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes for the following functions.
a) y = x−1
        3x
b) y = 4x+2
c) y = 2xx 2−2
            +3
           x 3
d) y = x2 −3x+2

**Solution:**

a) Vertical asymptotes:
Set the denominator equal to zero. x − 1 = 0 ⇒ x = 1 is the vertical asymptote.
Horizontal asymptote:
Keep only the highest powers of x. y = 1x ⇒ y = 0 is the horizontal asymptote.
b) Vertical asymptotes:
Set the denominator equal to zero. 4x + 2 = 0 ⇒ x = − 21 is the vertical asymptote.
Horizontal asymptote:
                                       3x
Keep only the highest powers of x. y = 4x ⇒ y = 34 is the horizontal asymptote.
c) Vertical asymptotes:
Set the denominator equal to zero: 2x2 + 3 = 0 ⇒ 2x2 = −3 ⇒ x2 = − 32 . Since there are no solutions to
this equation, there is no vertical asymptote.
Horizontal asymptote:
                                          2 ⇒ y = 2 is the horizontal asymptote.
                                        x         1
Keep only the highest powers of x. y = 2x
d) Vertical asymptotes:
Set the denominator equal to zero: x2 − 3x + 2 = 0
Factor: (x − 2)(x − 1) = 0
Solve: x = 2 and x = 1 are the vertical asymptotes.
Horizontal asymptote. There is no horizontal asymptote because the power of the numerator is larger
than the power of the denominator.
Notice the function in part d had more than one vertical asymptote. Here’s another function with two
vertical asymptotes.

**Example 6**

Graph the function y = x−x
                        2 −4 .


**Solution:**

Let’s set the denominator equal to zero:       x2 − 4 = 0


Factor:                                    (x − 2)(x + 2) = 0

Solve:                                     x = 2, x = −2
We ﬁnd that the function is undeﬁned for x = 2 and x = −2, so we know that there are vertical asymptotes
at these values of x.
We can also ﬁnd the horizontal asymptote by the method we outlined above. It’s at y = −x
                                                                                       x2
                                                                                          , or y = −1.
So, we start plotting the function by drawing the vertical and horizontal asymptotes on the graph.


Now, let’s make a table of values. Because our function has a lot of detail we must make sure that we
pick enough values for our table to determine the behavior of the function accurately. We must make sure
especially that we pick values close to the vertical asymptotes.

Solve Real-World Problems Using Rational Functions
Electrical circuits are commonplace is everyday life—for example, they’re in all the electrical appliances in
your home. The ﬁgure below shows an example of a simple electrical circuit. It consists of a battery which
provides a voltage (V, measured in Volts, V), a resistor (R, measured in ohms, Ω) which resists the ﬂow of
electricity and an ammeter that measures the current (I, measured in amperes, A) in the circuit.


Ohm’s Law gives a relationship between current, voltage and resistance. It states that

                                                         V
                                                    I=
                                                         R

Your light bulbs, toaster and hairdryer are all basically simple resistors. In addition, resistors are used
in an electrical circuit to control the amount of current ﬂowing through a circuit and to regulate voltage
levels. One important reason to do this is to prevent sensitive electrical components from burning out due
to too much current or too high a voltage level. Resistors can be arranged in series or in parallel.
For resistors placed in a series:


the total resistance is just the sum of the resistances of the individual resistors:

                                                Rtot = R1 + R2


For resistors placed in parallel:

the reciprocal of the total resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of the resistances of the individual
resistors:
                                                1    1   1
                                                   =   +
                                                Rc   R1 R2


**Example 7**

Find the quantity labeled x in the following circuit.


**Solution:**

We use the formula I = VR .

Plug in the known values:I = 2 A, V = 12 V :            2 = 12
                                                            R

Multiply both sides by R :                              2R = 12

Divide both sides by 2 :                                R = 6Ω    Answer

**Example 8**

Find the quantity labeled x in the following circuit.


**Solution:**

Ohm’s Law also tells us that Itotal = VRtotal
                                        total


Plug in the values we know, I = 2.5 A and E = 9 V :                  2.5 = R9tot

Multiply both sides by R :                                            2.5Rtot = 9


Divide both sides by 2.5 :                                                   Rtot = 3.6Ω

Since the resistors are placed in parallel, the total resistance is given by: R1tot = X1 + 20


                                                                      ⇒ 36
                                                                           = X1 + 20


                                                             1          1          1
Multiply all terms by 72X :                                 3.6 (72X) = X (72X) + 20 (72X)

Cancel common factors:                                     20X = 72 + 3.6X

Solve:                                                     16.4X = 72

Divide both sides by 16.4 :                                 X = 4.39Ω    Answer

Introduction
A rational expression is formed by taking the quotient of two polynomials.
Some examples of rational expressions are
                            2x       4x2 − 3x + 4     9x2 + 4x − 5      2x3
                          x −1
                           2              2x           x2 + 5x − 1     2x + 3

Just as with rational numbers, the expression on the top is called the numerator and the expression on
the bottom is called the denominator. In special cases we can simplify a rational expression by dividing
the numerator by the denominator.

Divide a Polynomial by a Monomial
We’ll start by dividing a polynomial by a monomial. To do this, we divide each term of the polynomial by
the monomial. When the numerator has more than one term, the monomial on the bottom of the fraction
serves as the common denominator to all the terms in the numerator.

**Example 1**

Divide.
a) 8x −4x+16
b) 3x +6x−1
       x

c) −3x −18x+6
       9x

**Solution:**

a) 8x −4x+16
     2                   2
       2     = 8x2 − 4x
                     2 + 2 = 4x − 2x + 8
                         16    2

     3                   3
b) 3x +6x−1          x − x = 3x + 6 − x
            = 3xx + 6x   1     2      1
       x

c) −3x −18x+6
         2                   2
       9x     = − 3x
                  9x − 9x + 9x = − 3 − 2 + 3x
                       18x  6      x       2

A common error is to cancel the denominator with just one term in the numerator.
Consider the quotient 3x+4
                        4 .
Remember that the denominator of 4 is common to both the terms in the numerator. In other words we
are dividing both of the terms in the numerator by the number 4.
The correct way to simplify is:
                                             3x + 4   3x 4  3x
                                                    =   + =    +1
                                                4     4  4  4

A common mistake is to cross out the number 4 from the numerator and the denominator, leaving just 3x.
This is incorrect, because the entire numerator needs to be divided by 4.

**Example 2**

Divide 5x −10x
               +x−25 2
            −5x2

**Solution:**

                                 5x3 − 10x2 + x − 25    5x3    10x2     x       25
                                                     =       −       +       −

The negative sign in the denominator changes all the signs of the fractions:
                                       5x3 10x2      x  25            1   5
                                   −      2
                                            +    2
                                                   − 2 + 2 = −x + 2 −   + 2

Divide a Polynomial by a Binomial
We divide polynomials using a method that’s a lot like long division with numbers. We’ll explain the
method by doing an example.

**Example 3**

Divide x +4x+5
         x+3 .

**Solution:**


When we perform division, the expression in the numerator is called the dividend and the expression in
the denominator is called the divisor.
To start the division we rewrite the problem in the following form:

                                              x + 3)x2 + 4x + 5

We start by dividing the ﬁrst term in the dividend by the ﬁrst term in the divisor: xx = x.
We place the answer on the line above the x term:
                                                         x
                                             x + 3)x2 + 4x + 5

Next, we multiply the x term in the answer by the divisor, x + 3, and place the result under the dividend,
matching like terms. x times (x + 3) is x2 + 3x, so we put that under the divisor:
                                                       x
                                             x + 3)x + 4x + 5
                                                    x2 + 3x

Now we subtract x2 + 3x from x2 + 4x + 5. It is useful to change the signs of the terms of x2 + 3x to −x2 − 3x
and add like terms vertically:
                                                         x
                                             x + 3)x2 + 4x + 5
                                                  −x2 − 3x
                                                             x

Now, we bring down the 5, the next term in the dividend.
                                                       x
                                             x + 3)x + 4x + 5
                                                  −x2 − 3x
                                                             x+5

And now we go through that procedure once more. First we divide the ﬁrst term of x + 5 by the ﬁrst
term of the divisor. x divided by x is 1, so we place this answer on the line above the constant term of the
dividend:
                                                             x + 1
                                             x + 3)x2 + 4x + 5
                                                  −x2 − 3x
                                                             x+5

Multiply 1 by the divisor, x + 3, and write the answer below x + 5, matching like terms.
                                                             x + 1
                                             x + 3)x2 + 4x + 5
                                                  −x2 − 3x
                                                             x+5
                                                             x+3

Subtract x + 3 from x + 5 by changing the signs of x + 3 to −x − 3 and adding like terms:
                                                        x + 1
                                            x + 3)x2 + 4x + 5
                                                −x2 − 3x
                                                        x+5
                                                      −x − 3

Since there are no more terms from the dividend to bring down, we are done. The quotient is x + 1 and
the remainder is 2.
Remember that for a division with a remainder the answer is quotient + remainder
                                                                         divisor . So the answer to this
                   x2 +4x+5           2
division problem is x+3 = x + 1 + x+3 .
Check
To check the answer to a long division problem we use the fact that

                               (divisor × quotient) + remainder = dividend

For the problem above, here’s how we apply that fact to check our solution:

                                   (x + 3)(x + 1) + 2 = x2 + 4x + 3 + 2
                                                     = x2 + 4x + 5

The answer checks out.

Rewrite and Graph Rational Functions
In the last section we saw how to ﬁnd vertical and horizontal asymptotes. Remember, the horizontal
asymptote shows the value of y that the function approaches for large values of x. Let’s review the method
for ﬁnding horizontal asymptotes and see how it’s related to polynomial division.
When it comes to ﬁnding asymptotes, there are basically four diﬀerent types of rational functions.
Case 1: The polynomial in the numerator has a lower degree than the polynomial in the denominator.
Take, for example, y = x−1 . We can’t reduce this fraction, and as x gets larger the denominator of the
fraction gets much bigger than the numerator, so the whole fraction approaches zero.
The horizontal asymptote is y = 0.
Case 2: The polynomial in the numerator has the same degree as the polynomial in the denominator.
Take, for example, y = 3x+2
                        x−1 . In this case we can divide the two polynomials:
                                              x − 1)3x + 2
                                                   −3x + 3

So the expression can be written as y = 3 + x−1 .
Because the denominator of the remainder is bigger than the numerator of the remainder, the remainder
will approach zero for large values of x. Adding the 3 to that 0 means the whole expression will approach
3.
The horizontal asymptote is y = 3.
Case 3: The polynomial in the numerator has a degree that is one more than the polynomial in the
denominator.
Take, for example, y = 4x +3x+2
                            x−1  . We can do long division once again and rewrite the expression as
y = 4x+7+ x−1 . The fraction here approaches zero for large values of x, so the whole expression approaches
4x + 7.
When the rational function approaches a straight line for large values of x, we say that the rational function
has an oblique asymptote. In this case, then, the oblique asymptote is y = 4x + 7.
Case 4: The polynomial in the numerator has a degree that in two or more than the degree in the
                               x3
denominator. For example: y = x−1 .
This is actually the simplest case of all: the polynomial has no horizontal or oblique asymptotes.

**Example 5**

Find the horizontal or oblique asymptotes of the following rational functions.
a) y = x3x
        2 +4


b) y = 3xx−1
          2 −6

         +1
c) y = xx−5
d) y = x −3xx2 −2
         3       2
               +4x−1


**Solution:**

a) When we simplify the function, we get y = 3 − x212
                                                    +4
                                                       . There is a horizontal asymptote at y = 3.
b) We cannot divide the two polynomials. There is a horizontal asymptote at y = 0.
c) The power of the numerator is 3 more than the power of the denominator. There are no horizontal
or oblique asymptotes.
d) When we simplify the function, we get y = x − 3 + 6x−7
                                                     x2 −2
                                                           . There is an oblique asymptote at y = x − 3.
Notice that a rational function will either have a horizontal asymptote, an oblique asymptote or neither
kind. In other words, a function can’t have both; in fact, it can’t have more than one of either kind. On
the other hand, a rational function can have any number of vertical asymptotes at the same time that it
has horizontal or oblique asymptotes.

Introduction
A simpliﬁed rational expression is one where the numerator and denominator have no common factors. In
order to simplify an expression to lowest terms, we factor the numerator and denominator as much as
we can and cancel common factors from the numerator and the denominator.


Simplify Rational Expressions

**Example 1**

Reduce each rational expression to simplest terms.
a) 2x4x−2
     2 +x−1

    2−2x+1
b) x 8x−8
        −4
c) x2x−5x+6

**Solution:**

                                                               2(2x−1)
a) Factor the numerator and denominator completely:          (2x−1)(x+1)

Cancel the common factor (2x − 1) :                            2
                                                              x+1
                                                             (x−1)(x−1)
b) Factor the numerator and denominator completely:            8(x−1)

Cancel the common factor (x − 1) :                             x−1
                                                             (x−2)(x+2)
c) Factor the numerator and denominator completely:          (x−2)(x−3)

Cancel the common factor(x − 2) :                             x+2
                                                              x−3
When reducing fractions, you are only allowed to cancel common factors from the denominator but NOT
                                                 (x+1)·(x−3)
common terms. For example, in the expression (x+2)·(x−3) , we can cross out the (x − 3) factor because
(x−3)                              2
(x−3)
      = 1. But in the expression xx2+1
                                     −5
                                        we can’t just cross out the x2 terms.
Why can’t we do that? When we cross out terms that are part of a sum or a diﬀerence, we’re violating
the order of operations (PEMDAS). Remember, the fraction bar means division. When we perform the
operation xx2+1
              −5
                 , we’re really performing the division (x2 + 1) ÷ (x2 − 5) — and the order of operations says
that we must perform the operations inside the parentheses before we can perform the division.
Using numbers instead of variables makes it more obvious that canceling individual terms doesn’t work.
You can see that 9+1   10                                                      1
                 9−5 = 4 = 2.5 — but if we canceled out the 9’s ﬁrst, we’d get −5 , or -0.2, instead.

Find Excluded Values of Rational Expressions
Whenever there’s a variable expression in the denominator of a fraction, we must remember that the
denominator could be zero when the independent variable takes on certain values. Those values, corre-
sponding to the vertical asymptotes of the function, are called excluded values. To ﬁnd the excluded
values, we simply set the denominator equal to zero and solve the resulting equation.

**Example 2**


Figure 12.2: Simplifying Rational Expressions - YourTeacher.com - Math Help (Watch Youtube Video)


Find the excluded values of the following expressions.
    x
a) x+4
b) x2x+1
    2 −x−6

c) x2 −5x

**Solution:**

a) When we set the denominator equal to zero we obtain:       x + 4 = 0 ⇒ x = −4

So −4 is the excluded value.
b) When we set the denominator equal to zero we obtain:        x2 − x − 6 = 0

Solve by factoring:                                          (x − 3)(x + 2) = 0

                                                              ⇒ x = 3 and x = −2

So 3 and −2 are the excluded values.
c) When we set the denominator equal to zero we obtain:       x2 − 5x = 0

Solve by factoring:                                           x(x − 5) = 0

                                                               ⇒ x = 0 and x = 5

So 0 and 5 are the excluded values.


Removable Zeros
Notice that in the expressions in Example 1, we removed a division by zero when we simpliﬁed the problem.
                                        2(2x−1)
For instance, we rewrote 2x4x−2                                                                         1
                            2 +x−1 as (2x−1)(x+1) . The denominator of this expression is zero when x = 2 or

when x = −1.
However, when we cancel common factors, we simplify the expression to x+1 . This reduced form allows
the value x = 2 , so x = −1 is its only excluded value.

Technically the original expression and the simpliﬁed expression are not the same. When we recduce a
radical expression to its simplest form, we should specify the removed excluded value. In other words, we
                                    2 +x−1 = x+1 , x , 2 .
should write our ﬁnal answer as 2x4x−2        2        1

                                                                  −2x+1
Similarly, we should write the answer from Example 1, part b as x 8x−8     8 , x , 1 and the answer from
                                                                        = x−1

                         2−4
Example 1, part c as x2x−5x+6   x−3 , x , 2.
                              = x+2

Introduction
The rules for multiplying and dividing rational expressions are the same as the rules for multiplying and
dividing rational numbers, so let’s start by reviewing multiplication and division of fractions. When we
multiply two fractions we multiply the numerators and denominators separately:
                                               a c  a·c
                                                · =
                                               b d  b·d

When we divide two fractions, we replace the second fraction with its reciprocal and multiply, since that’s
mathematically the same operation:

                                           a c a d  a·d
                                            ÷ = · =
                                           b d b c  b·c


Multiply Rational Expressions Involving Monomials

**Example 1**

                            8 · 5a2 .
                         a      4b
Multiply the following: 16b

**Solution:**

Cancel common factors from the numerator and denominator. The common factors are 4, a, and b3 .
Canceling them out leaves 4b15 · 5a
                                 1      1
                                    = 20ab5.


**Example 2**

                4y2
Multiply 9x2 · 21x 4.


**Solution:**

                                                    2    24y
Rewrite the problem as a product of two fractions: 9x1 · 21x 4 Then cancel common factors from the numerator
and denominator.
                                                                 4y 2   12y2
The common factors are 3 and x2 . Canceling them out leaves 13 · 7x 2 = 7x2 .


Multiply Rational Expressions Involving Polynomials
When multiplying rational expressions involving polynomials, ﬁrst we need to factor all polynomial ex-
pressions as much as we can. Then we follow the same procedure as before.


**Example 3**

Multiply 4x+12
          3x2
               · x2x−9 .

**Solution:**

                                                               4(x+3)
Factor all polynomial expressions as much as possible:           3x2
                                                                      · (x+3)(x−3)
                                                                            x

The common factors are x and (x + 3). Canceling them leaves 3x · (x−3)
                                                                   1        4
                                                                       = 3x(x−3) = 3x24−9x .

**Example 4**

Multiply 12xx2−x−6
                   2    2
              −1
                   · 4xx2 −27x+18
                          +7x+6
                                  .

**Solution:**

                           (3x+2)(4x−3) (x+1)(x+6)
Factor polynomials:         (x+1)(x−1)
                                       · (4x−3)(x−6) .
                                                                            (3x+2) (x+6)   (3x+2)(x+6)     2
The common factors are (x + 1) and (4x − 3). Canceling them leaves (x−1) · (x−6) =          (x−1)(x−6)
                                                                                                       = 3xx2+20x+12
                                                                                                             −7x+6


Multiply a Rational Expression by a Polynomial
When we multiply a rational expression by a whole number or a polynomial, we can write the whole
number (or polynomial) as a fraction with denominator equal to one. We then proceed the same way as
in the previous examples.

**Example 5**

Multiply 4x23x+18
             +19x−5
                    · (x2 + 3x − 10).

**Solution:**

Rewrite the expression as a product of fractions: 4x23x+18
                                                      +19x−5
                                                             · x +3x−10
                             3(x+6)     (x−2)(x+5)
Factor polynomials: (x+5)(4x−1) ·            1
                                                         3(x+6)   (x−2)  3(x+6)(x−2) 2
The common factor is (x + 5). Canceling it leaves (4x−1) ·          1   = (4x−1) = 3x +12x−36
                                                                                       4x−1


Divide Rational Expressions Involving Polynomials
Just as with ordinary fractions, we ﬁrst rewrite the division problem as a multiplication problem and then
proceed with the multiplication as outlined in the previous example.
Note: Remember that ab ÷ dc = ba · dc . The ﬁrst fraction remains the same and you take the reciprocal of
the second fraction. Do not fall into the common trap of ﬂipping the ﬁrst fraction.

**Example 6**

       15 ÷ 5 .
Divide 4x   6x


**Solution:**

First convert into a multiplication problem by ﬂipping the second fraction and then simplify as usual:

                                            4x2 6x   4x2 5   2x 1  2x
                                               ÷   =    ·  =   · =
                                            15   5   15 6x   3 3   9


**Example 7**

              −15x
               2          x −25
Divide 2x3x2 +3x−14 ÷ 2x2 +13x+21 .

**Solution:**


     3x2 − 15x     2x2 + 13x + 21      3x(x − 5)     (2x + 7)(x + 3)     3x     (x + 3)     3x2 + 9x
                 ·                =                ·                 =        ·         =
   2x2 + 3x − 14       x2 − 25      (2x + 7)(x − 2) (x − 5)(x + 5)     (x − 2) (x + 5)    x2 + 3x − 10


Divide a Rational Expression by a Polynomial
When we divide a rational expression by a whole number or a polynomial, we can write the whole number
(or polynomial) as a fraction with denominator equal to one, and then proceed the same way as in the
previous examples.

**Example 8**

         2−4
       2x−2 ÷ (21x − 2x − 8).
Divide 9x         2


**Solution:**

Rewrite the expression as a division of fractions, and then convert into a multiplication problem by taking
the reciprocal of the divisor:

                             9x2 − 4 21x2 − 2x − 8   9x2 − 4     1
                                    ÷              =         ·
                             2x − 2        1         2x − 2 21x − 2x − 8


Then factor and solve:

    9x2 − 4     1         (3x − 2)(3x + 2)           1          (3x + 2)     1         3x + 2
            ·           =                  ·                  =          ·        =
    2x − 2 21x − 2x − 8
              2               2(x − 1)       (3x − 2)(7x + 4)   2(x − 1) (7x + 4)   14x2 − 6x − 8

**Example 9**

Suppose Marciel is training for a running race. Marciel’s speed (in miles per hour) of his training run each
morning is given by the function x3 − 9x, where x is the number of bowls of cereal he had for breakfast.
Marciel’s training distance (in miles), if he eats x bowls of cereal, is 3x2 − 9x. What is the function for
Marciel’s time, and how long does it take Marciel to do his training run if he eats ﬁve bowls of cereal on
Tuesday morning?


**Solution:**

time = distance
        speed

           −9x      2                       3x(x−3)   3x(x−3)
time = 3x
        x3 −9x
               = x(x2 −9) = x(x+3)(x−3)

time = x+3

If x = 5, then

time = 5+3 = 38
Marciel will run for 38 of an hour.

### Learning Objectives

- Add and subtract rational expressions with the same denominator.
- Find the least common denominator of rational expressions.
- Add and subtract rational expressions with diﬀerent denominators.
- Solve real-world problems involving addition and subtraction of rational expressions.


Introduction
Like fractions, rational expressions represent a portion of a quantity. Remember that when we add or
subtract fractions we must ﬁrst make sure that they have the same denominator. Once the fractions have
the same denominator, we combine the diﬀerent portions by adding or subtracting the numerators and
writing that answer over the common denominator.


Add and Subtract Rational Expressions with the Same Denomi-
nator
Fractions with common denominators combine in the following manner:
                                         a b  a+b                   a b  a−b
                                          + =               and      − =
                                         c c   c                    c c   c

**Example 1**

Simplify.

b) 4xx+5  + 2xx+5
    2−2x+1       −3x+52
c) x 2x+3  − 3x 2x+3

**Solution:**

a) Since the denominators are the same we combine the numerators:
                                     8 2 4       8−2+4      10
                                       − + =              =
                                     7 7 7           7       7
                                                                                  4x2 −3+2x2 −1
b) Since the denominators are the same we combine the numerators:                      x+5
                                                                                   6x2 −4
Simplify by collecting like terms:                                                  x+5
c) Since the denominators are the same we combine the numerators. Make sure the subtraction sign is
distributed to all terms in the second expression:
                          x2 − 2x + 1 − (3x2 − 3x + 5)   x2 − 2x + 1 − 3x2 + 3x − 5   −2x2 + x − 4
                                                       =                            =
                                     2x + 3                        2x + 3               2x + 3

Find the Least Common Denominator of Rational Expressions
To add and subtract fractions with diﬀerent denominators, we must ﬁrst rewrite all fractions so that they
have the same denominator. In general, we want to ﬁnd the least common denominator. To ﬁnd
the least common denominator, we ﬁnd the least common multiple (LCM) of the expressions in the
denominators of the diﬀerent fractions. Remember that the least common multiple of two or more integers
is the least positive integer that has all of those integers as factors.
The procedure for ﬁnding the lowest common multiple of polynomials is similar. We rewrite each polynomial
in factored form and we form the LCM by taking each factor to the highest power it appears in any of the
separate expressions.

Find the LCM of 48x2 y and 60xy3 z.

**Solution:**

First rewrite the integers in their prime factorization.

                                                 48 = 24 · 3
                                                 60 = 22 · 3 · 5

The two expressions can be written as:

                                         48x2 y = 24 · 3 · x2 · y
                                         60xy3 z = 22 · 3 · 5 · x · y3 · z

To ﬁnd the LCM, take the highest power of each factor that appears in either expression.

                                   LCM = 24 · 3 · 5 · x2 · y3 · z = 240x2 y3 z


**Example 3**

Find the LCM of 2x2 + 8x + 8 and x3 − 4x2 − 12x

**Solution:**

Factor the polynomials completely:

                                       2x2 + 8x + 8 = 2(x2 + 4x + 4)
                                                       = 2(x + 2)2


                                      x3 − 4x2 − 12x = x(x2 − 4x − 12)
                                                       = x(x + 2)(x − 6)

To ﬁnd the LCM, take the highest power of each factor that appears in either expression.

                                          LCM = 2x(x + 2)2 (x − 6)

It’s customary to leave the LCM in factored form, because this form is useful in simplifying rational
expressions and ﬁnding any excluded values.

**Example 4**


Find the LCM of x2 − 25 and x2 + 3x + 2

**Solution:**

Factor the polynomials completely:

                                            x2 − 25 = (x − 5)(x + 5)
                                       x2 + 3x + 2 = (x + 1)(x + 2)

Since the two expressions have no common factors, the LCM is just the product of the two expressions.

                                   LCM = (x − 5)(x + 5)(x + 1)(x + 2)


Add and Subtract Rational Expressions with Diﬀerent Denomi-
nators
Now we’re ready to add and subtract rational expressions. We use the following procedure.

  1. Find the least common denominator (LCD) of the fractions.
  2. Express each fraction as an equivalent fraction with the LCD as the denominator.
  3. Add or subtract and simplify the result.


**Example 5**

Perform the following operation and simplify: x+2 − 2x−5


**Solution:**

The denominators can’t be factored any further, so the LCD is just the product of the separate denomi-
nators: (x + 2)(2x − 5). That means the ﬁrst fraction needs to be multiplied by the factor (2x − 5) and the
second fraction needs to be multiplied by the factor (x + 2):

                                       2    (2x − 5)   3    (x + 2)
                                          ·          −    ·
                                     x + 2 (2x − 5) 2x − 5 (x + 2)

                                                 2(2x−5)−3(x+2)   4x−10−3x−6
Combine the numerators and simplify:               (x+2)(2x−5)
                                                                = (x+2)(2x−5)

                                                   x−16
Combine like terms in the numerator:            (x+2)(2x−5)
                                                              Answer

**Example 6**

                                               4x
Perform the following operation and simplify: x−5 − 5−x
                                                     3x
                                                        .

**Solution:**

Notice that the denominators are almost the same; they just diﬀer by a factor of -1.

                                                                           x−5 − −(x−5)
                                                                            4x     3x
Factor out -1 from the second denominator:

                                                                           4x     3x
The two negative signs in the second fraction cancel:                     x−5 + (x−5)

                                                                           7x
Since the denominators are the same we combine the numerators:            x−5   Answer

**Example 7**

Perform the following operation and simplify: x22x−1
                                                −6x+9
                                                      − 3x+4
                                                        x2 −9
                                                              .


**Solution:**

We factor the denominators:                  2x−1
                                            (x−3)2
                                                   − (x+3)(x−3)
                                                        3x+4


The LCD is the product of all the diﬀerent factors, each taken to the highest power they have in either
denominator: (x − 3)2 (x + 3).
The ﬁrst fraction needs to be multiplied by a factor of (x+3) and the second fraction needs to be multiplied
by a factor of (x − 3):

                                    2x − 1 (x + 3)     3x + 4      (x − 3)

                                   (x − 3) (x + 3) (x + 3)(x − 3) (x − 3)


                                                                  (2x−1)(x+3)−(3x+4)(x−3)
Combine the numerators by subtracting:                                  (x−3)2 (x+3)

                                                                  2x2 +5x−3−(3x2 −5x−12)

**Example 8**

In an electrical circuit with two resistors placed in parallel, the reciprocal of the total resistance is equal to
the sum of the reciprocals of each resistance: R1tot = R11 + R12 . Find an expression for the total resistance,
Rtot .

**Solution:**

Let’s simplify the expression R11 + R12 .

The lowest common denominator is R1 R2 , so we multiply the ﬁrst fraction by RR22 and the

second fraction by RR11 :                                          R2 · R1 + R1 · R2
                                                                   R2   1    R1   1


                                                                   R2 +R1
Simplify:                                                           R1 R2

The total resistance is the reciprocal of this expression:       Rtot = RR11+R
                                                                             R2
                                                                                   Answer

**Example 9**

The sum of a number and its reciprocal is 53
                                          14 . Find the numbers.

**Solution:**

Deﬁne variables:
Let x be the number; then its reciprocal is 1x .
Set up an equation:
The equation that describes the relationship between the numbers is x + 1x = 14
Solve the equation:
Find the lowest common denominator:            LCM = 14x

Multiply all terms by 14x :                    14x · x + 14x · 1x = 14x · 53
(Notice that we’re multiplying the terms by 14x instead of by 14x
                                                              14x . We can do this because we’re multiplying
both sides of the equation by the same thing, so we don’t have to keep the actual values of the terms the
same. We could also multiply by 14x14x , but then the denominators would just cancel out a couple of steps
later.)
Cancel common factors in each term:                14x · x + 14x · 1x = 14x · 53

Simplify:                                          14x2 + 14 = 53x

Write all terms on one side of the equation:        14x2 − 53x + 14 = 0

Factor:                                             (7x − 2)(2x − 7) = 0

                                                    x = 72 and x = 72
Notice there are two answers for x, but they are really parts of the same solution. One answer represents
the number and the other answer represents its reciprocal.
Check:
2   7  4+49  53
7 + 2 = 14 = 14 . The answer checks out.
Work problems are problems where two people or two machines work together to complete a job. Work
problems often contain rational expressions. Typically we set up such problems by looking at the part of
the task completed by each person or machine. The completed task is the sum of the parts of the tasks
completed by each individual or each machine.
To determine the part of the task completed by each person or machine we use the following fact:
                    Part of the task completed = rate of work × time spent on the task

It’s usually useful to set up a table where we can list all the known and unknown variables for each person
or machine and then combine the parts of the task completed by each person or machine at the end.

**Example 10**

Mary can paint a house by herself in 12 hours. John can paint a house by himself in 16 hours. How long
would it take them to paint the house if they worked together?

**Solution:**


Deﬁne variables:
Let t = the time it takes Mary and John to paint the house together.
Construct a table:
Since Mary takes 12 hours to paint the house by herself, in one hour she paints 12 of the house.
Since John takes 16 hours to pain the house by himself, in one hour he paints 16 of the house.
Mary and John work together for t hours to paint the house together. Using

                    Part o f the task completed = rate o f work · time spent on the task

we can write that Mary completed 12t of the house and John completed 16t of the house in this time.
This information is nicely summarized in the table below:

                                               Table 12.6:

 Painter                   Rate of work (per           Time worked                    Part of task
                           hour)
                            1                                                          t
 Mary                      12                          t                              12
                            1                                                          t
 John                      16                          t                              16


Set up an equation:
In t hours, Mary painted 12t of the house and John painted 16t of the house, and together they painted 1
whole house. So our equation is 12t + 16t = 1.
Solve the equation:
Find the lowest common denominator:                    LCM = 48

Multiply all terms in the equation by the LCM:         48 · 12t + 48 · 16t = 48 · 1

Cancel common factors in each term:                    4 · 1t + 3 · 1t = 48 · 1

Simplify:                                              4t + 3t = 48

                                                       7t = 48 ⇒ t = 48
                                                                      7 = 6.86 hours
Check: The answer is reasonable. We’d expect the job to take more than half the time Mary would take
by herself but less than half the time John would take, since Mary works faster than John.

**Example 11**

Suzie and Mike take two hours to mow a lawn when they work together. It takes Suzie 3.5 hours to mow
the same lawn if she works by herself. How long would it take Mike to mow the same lawn if he worked
alone?

**Solution:**

Deﬁne variables:
Let t = the time it takes Mike to mow the lawn by himself.
Construct a table:


                                             Table 12.7:

 Painter                  Rate of work (per         Time worked                  Part of Task

                            1    2                                               4
 Suzie                     3.5 = 7                  2                            7
                           1                                                     2
 Mike                      t                        2                            t


Set up an equation:
Since Suzie completed 47 of the lawn and Mike completed 2t of the lawn and together they mowed the lawn
in 2 hours, we can write the equation: 47 + 2t = 1
Solve the equation:
Find the lowest common denominator:                  LCM = 7t

Multiply all terms in the equation by the LCM:      7t · 74 + 7t · 2t = 7t · 1

Cancel common factors in each term:                 t · 41 + 7 · 12 = 7t · 1

Simplify:                                            4t + 14 = 7t

                                                    3t = 14 ⇒ t = 14     2
                                                                   3 = 4 3 hours
Check: The answer is reasonable. We’d expect Mike to work slower than Suzie, because working by herself
it takes her less than twice the time it takes them to work together.

## 12.7 Solutions of Rational Equations


### Learning Objectives

- Solve rational equations using cross products.
- Solve rational equations using lowest common denominators.
- Solve real-world problems with rational equations.

Introduction
A rational equation is one that contains rational expressions. It can be an equation that contains rational
coeﬀicients or an equation that contains rational terms where the variable appears in the denominator.
An example of the ﬁrst kind of equation is: 35 x + 21 = 4.
                                               x          4
An example of the second kind of equation is: x−1 + 1 = 2x+3 .
The ﬁrst aim in solving a rational equation is to eliminate all denominators. That way, we can change a
rational equation to a polynomial equation which we can solve with the methods we have learned this far.

Solve Rational Equations Using Cross Products
A rational equation that contains just one term on each side is easy to solve by cross multiplication.
Consider the following equation:
                                                    x   x+1
                                                      =
                                                    5    2
Our ﬁrst goal is to eliminate the denominators of both rational expressions. In order to remove the 5 from
the denominator of the ﬁrst fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5:
                                                    x     x+1
                                               5·     =5·
                                                    5        2
                                                       5(x + 1)
                                                    x=
Now, we remove the 2 from the denominator of the second fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation
by 2:
                                                        5(x + 1)
                                               2·x=2·
                                                2x = 5(x + 1)

Then we can solve this equation for x.
Notice that this equation is what we would get if we simply multiplied each numerator in the original
equation by the denominator from the opposite side of the equation. It turns out that we can always simplify
a rational equation with just two terms by multiplying each numerator by the opposite denominator; this
is called cross multiplication.

**Example 1**

                    2x
Solve the equation x+4 = 5x .

**Solution:**

Cross-multiply. The equation simpliﬁes to:               2x2 = 5(x + 4)

Simplify:                                                2x2 = 5x + 20

Move all terms to one side of the equation:               2x2 − 5x − 20 = 0
                                                                  √
Solve using the quadratic formula:                        x = 5± 4185 ⇒ x = −2.15 or x = 4.65
It’s important to plug the answer back into the original equation when the variable appears in any denom-
inator of the equation, because the answer might be an excluded value of one of the rational expressions.
If the answer obtained makes any denominator equal to zero, that value is not really a solution to the
equation.
                                  ⇒ −4.30
                     2(−2.15) ?            ?
        2x
Check: x+4 = 5x ⇒ −2.15+4 = −2.15
                                     1.85 = − 2.3 ⇒ −2.3 = −2.3. The answer checks out.
          2(4.65) ? 5     9.3 ?
x+4 = x ⇒ 4.65+4 = 4.65 ⇒ 8.65 =1.08 ⇒ 1.08 = 1.08. The answer checks out.

Solve Rational Equations Using Lowest Common Denominators
Another way of eliminating the denominators in a rational equation is to multiply all the terms in the
equation by the lowest common denominator. You can use this method even when there are more than

two terms in the equation.

**Example 2**

Solve x+2 − x−5
             4        2
                = x2 −3x−10 .

**Solution:**


                                                              x+2 − x−5 = (x+2)(x−5)
                                                               3     4        2
Factor all denominators:

Find the lowest common denominator:                              LCD = (x + 2)(x − 5)

Multiply all terms in the equation by the LCD:

                                    3                      4                           2
                (x + 2)(x − 5) ·       − (x + 2)(x − 5) ·     = (x + 2)(x − 5) ·
                                   x+2                    x−5                    (x + 2)(x − 5)

The equation simpliﬁes to:                                        3(x − 5) − 4(x + 2) = 2

Simplify:                                                          3x − 15 − 4x − 8 = 2

                                                                    x = −25
                                                   ?
Check: x+2 − x−5
              4        2
                 = x2 −3x−10 ⇒ −25+2
                                     − −25−5
                                         4              2
                                             = (−25)2 −3(−25)−10 ⇒ .003 = .003. The answer checks out.

**Example 3**

       2x     x
Solve 2x+1 + x+4 = 1.

**Solution:**

Find the lowest common denominator:                    LCD = (2x + 1)(x + 4)

Multiply all terms in the equation by the LCD:

                                            2x                        x
                      (2x + 1)(x + 4) ·          + (2x + 1)(x + 4) ·     = (2x + 1)(x + 4)
                                          2x + 1                     x+4

Cancel all common terms.                               2x(x + 4) + x(2x + 1) = (2x + 1)(x + 4)
The simpliﬁed equation is:

Eliminate parentheses:                                 2x2 + 8x + 2x2 + x = 2x2 + 9x + 4

Collect like terms:                                    2x2 = 4
                                                                     √
                                                       x2 = 2 ⇒ x = ± 2
                         √     √
        2x     x       2
                       √ 2 + √ 2 = 0.739 + 0.261 = 1. The answer checks out.
Check: 2x+1 + x+4 =
                      2 2+1    2+4
                 √           √
              2(− 2)       −
2x+1 + x+4 = 2(− 2)+1 + − 2+4 = 1.547 − 0.547 = 1. The answer checks out.

Solve Real-World Problems Using Rational Equations
A motion problem with no acceleration is described by the formula distance = speed ×time. These problems
can involve the addition and subtraction of rational expressions.


**Example 4**

Last weekend Nadia went canoeing on the Snake River. The current of the river is three miles per hour.
It took Nadia the same amount of time to travel 12 miles downstream as it did to travel 3 miles upstream.
Determine how fast Nadia’s canoe would travel in still water.

**Solution:**

Deﬁne variables:
Let s = speed of the canoe in still water
Then, s + 3 = the speed of the canoe traveling downstream
s − 3 = the speed of the canoe traveling upstream
Construct a table:
                                                Table 12.8:

 Direction                  Distance (miles)             Rate                   Time
 Downstream                 12                           s+3                    t
 Upstream                   3                            s−3                    t


Write an equation:
Since distance = rate × time, we can say that time = distance
                                                       rate .
The time to go downstream is:                                                       t = s+3

The time to go upstream is:                                                         t = s−3

                                                                                     3     12
Since the time it takes to go upstream and downstream are the same, we have:        s−3 = s+3
Solve the equation:
Cross-multiply:                   3(s + 3) = 12(s − 3)

Simplify:                         3s + 9 = 12s − 36

Solve:                            s = 5 mi/h
Check: Upstream: t = 12     1                       3     1
                      8 = 1 2 hour; downstream: t = 2 = 1 2 hour. The answer checks out.

**Example 5**

Peter rides his bicycle. When he pedals uphill he averages a speed of eight miles per hour, when he pedals
downhill he averages 14 miles per hour. If the total distance he travels is 40 miles and the total time he
rides is four hours, how long did he ride at each speed?

**Solution:**

Deﬁne variables:
Let t = time Peter bikes at 8 miles per hour.
Construct a table:


                                                 Table 12.9:

 Direction                    Distance (miles)           Rate (mph)                  Time (hours)
 Uphill                       d                          8                           t1
 Downhill                     40 − d                     14                          t2


Write an equation:
We know that time = distance
                      rate .
The time to go uphill is:                           t1 = 8d

The time to go downhill is:                         t2 = 40−d

                                                    d  40−d
We also know that the total time is 4 hours:        8 + 14 = 4
Solve the equation:
Find the lowest common denominator:                            LCD = 56

Multiply all terms by the common denominator:                  7d + 160 − 4d = 224

Solve:                                                         d = 21.3 mi
Check: Uphill: t = 21.3
                    8 = 2.67 hours; downhill: t =
                                                  40−21.3
                                                    14    = 1.33 hours. The answer checks out.

**Example 6**

A group of friends decided to pool together and buy a birthday gift that cost $200. Later 12 of the friends
decided not to participate any more. This meant that each person paid $15 more than their original share.
How many people were in the group to begin with?

**Solution:**

Deﬁne variables:
Let x = the number of friends in the original group.
Make a table:
                                               Table 12.10:

                              Number of people           Gift price                  Share amount
 Original group               x                          200                           x
 Later group                  x − 12                     200                          200
                                                                                     x−12


Write an equation:
Since each person’s share went up by $15 after 2 people refused to pay, we write the equation x−12 = 200
                                                                                                      x +15
Solve the equation:
Find the lowest common denominator:            LCD = x(x − 12)

Multiply all terms by the LCD:                 x(x − 12) · x−12
                                                                = x(x − 12) · 200
                                                                               x + x(x − 12) · 15

Cancel common factors and simplify:              200x = 200(x − 12) + 15x(x − 12)

Eliminate parentheses:                        200x = 200x − 2400 + 15x2 − 180x

Get all terms on one side of the equation:    0 = 15x2 = 180x − 2400

Divide all terms by 15 :                      0 = x2 − 12x − 160

Factor:                                      0 = (x − 20)(x + 8)

Solve:                                        x = 20, x = −8
The answer that makes sense is x = 20 people.
Check: Originally $200 shared among 20 people is $10 each. After 12 people leave, $200 shared among 8
people is $25 each. So each person pays $15 more. The answer checks out.
