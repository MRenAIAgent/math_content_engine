## Mathematical Practices

## Specifying Units of Measure

## Core Concept

## Operations and Unit Analysis

## Addition and Subtraction

When you add or subtract quantities, they must have the same units of measure.
The sum or difference will have the same unit of measure.

## Example

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/b1c41e13-cafa-46c5-832c-01ea0043bde5-03.jpg?height=188&width=293&top_left_y=831&top_left_x=449)

Perimeter of rectangle

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =(3 \mathrm{ft})+(5 \mathrm{ft})+(3 \mathrm{ft})+(5 \mathrm{ft}) \\
& =16 \text { feet } \longleftrightarrow \begin{array}{l}
\text { When you add feet, } \\
\text { you get feet. }
\end{array}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Multiplication and Division

When you multiply or divide quantities, the product or quotient will have a different unit of measure.

Example

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Area of rectangle } & =(3 \mathrm{ft}) \times(5 \mathrm{ft}) \\
& =15 \text { square feet }
\end{aligned}
$$

## EXAMPLE 1 Specifying Units of Measure

You work 8 hours and earn $\$ 72$. What is your hourly wage?

## SOLUTION

## Core Concept

## Four-Step Approach to Problem Solving

1. Understand the Problem What is the unknown? What information is being given? What is being asked?
2. Make a Plan This plan might involve one or more of the problem-solving strategies shown on the next page.
3. Solve the Problem Carry out your plan. Check that each step is correct.
4. Look Back Examine your solution. Check that your solution makes sense in the original statement of the problem.

## EXAMPLE 3 Modeling with Mathematics

In the 2012 Olympics, Usain Bolt won the 200 -meter dash with a time of 19.32 seconds. Write and solve an equation to find his average speed to the nearest hundredth of a meter per second.

## SOLUTION

1. Understand the Problem You know the winning time and the distance of the race. You are asked to find the average speed to the nearest hundredth of a meter per second.
2. Make a Plan Use the Distance Formula to write an equation that represents the problem. Then solve the equation.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/b1c41e13-cafa-46c5-832c-01ea0043bde5-07.jpg?height=594&width=372&top_left_y=964&top_left_x=1495)
3. Solve the Problem

$$
\begin{aligned}
d & =r \cdot t & & \text { Write the Distance Formula. } \\
200 & =r \cdot 19.32 & & \text { Substitute } 200 \text { for } d \text { and } 19.32 \text { for } t . \\
\frac{200}{19.32} & =\frac{19.32 r}{19.32} & & \text { Divide each side by } 19.32 . \\
10.35 & \approx r & & \text { Simplify. }
\end{aligned}
$$

- Bolt's average speed was about 10.35 meters per second.

4. Look Back Round Bolt's average speed to 10 meters per second. At this speed, it would take

$$
\frac{200 \mathrm{~m}}{10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}}=20 \text { seconds }
$$

to run 200 meters. Because 20 is close to 19.32, your solution is reasonable.

## Monitoring Progress

7. Suppose Usain Bolt ran 400 meters at the same average speed that he ran the 200 meters. How long would it take him to run 400 meters? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth of a second.

## REMEMBER

The distance between two points on a number line is always positive.

## SOLUTION

1. Understand the Problem You know the temperature before and after the temperature fell. You are asked to find how many degrees the temperature fell.
2. Make a Plan Use a verbal model to write an equation that represents the problem. Then solve the equation.
3. Solve the Problem

Words $\quad \begin{aligned} & \text { Temperature } \\ & \text { at 9:27 A.M. }\end{aligned}=\begin{aligned} & \text { Temperature } \\ & \text { at 9:00 A.M. }\end{aligned}-\begin{aligned} & \text { Number of degrees } \\ & \text { the temperature fell }\end{aligned}$
Variable Let $T$ be the number of degrees the temperature fell.

Equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
-4 & =54 & & T \\
-4 & =54-T & & \text { Write the equation. } \\
-4-54 & =54-54-T & & \text { Subtract 54 from each side. } \\
-58 & =-T & & \text { Simplify. } \\
58 & =T & & \text { Divide each side by }-1 .
\end{aligned}
$$

The temperature fell $58^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.
4. Look Back The temperature fell from 54 degrees above 0 to 4 degrees below 0 . You can use a number line to check that your solution is reasonable.

# 1.2 Solving Multi-Step Equations 

## JUSTIFYING CONCLUSIONS

To be proficient in math, you need to be sure your answers make sense in the context of the problem. For instance, if you find the angle measures of a triangle, and they have a sum that is not equal to $180^{\circ}$, then you should check your work for mistakes.

Essential Question How can you use multi-step equations to solve real-life problems?

## EXPLORATION 1 Solving for the Angle Measures of a Polygon

Work with a partner. The sum $S$ of the angle measures of a polygon with $n$ sides can be found using the formula $S=180(n-2)$. Write and solve an equation to find each value of $x$. Justify the steps in your solution. Then find the angle measures of each polygon. How can you check the reasonableness of your answers?

## What You Will Learn

## EXAMPLE 3 Using Structure to Solve a Multi-Step Equation

LOOKING FOR STRUCTURE

First solve for the expression $1-x$, and then solve for $x$.

Solve $2(1-x)+3=-8$. Check your solution.

## SOLUTION

Method 1 One way to solve the equation is by using the Distributive Property.

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
2(1-x)+3 & =-8 & & \text { Write the equation. } \\
2(1)-2(x)+3 & =-8 & & \text { Distributive Property } \\
2-2 x+3 & =-8 & & \text { Multiply. } \\
-2 x+5 & =-8 & & \text { Combine like terms. } \\
\frac{-5}{-2 x} & =-13 & & \text { Subtract } 5 \text { from each side. } \\
\frac{-2 x}{-2} & =\frac{-13}{-2} & & \text { Simplify. } \\
x & =6.5 & & \text { Divide each side by }-2 . \\
& \text { Simplify. }
\end{array}
$$

The solution is $x=6.5$.

## Check

$$
\begin{aligned}
2(1-x)+3 & =-8 \\
2(1-6.5)+3 & \stackrel{?}{=}-8 \\
-8 & =-8
\end{aligned}
$$

Method 2 Another way to solve the equation is by interpreting the expression $1-x$ as a single quantity.

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
2(1-x)+3 & =-8 & & \text { Write the equation. } \\
\underline{-3}=\underline{-3} & & \text { Subtract } 3 \text { from each side. } \\
2(1-x)=-11 & & \text { Simplify. } \\
\frac{2(1-x)}{2}=\frac{-11}{2} & & \text { Divide each side by } 2 . \\
1-x=-5.5 & & \text { Simplify. } \\
\frac{-1}{-x} & =-6.5 & & \text { Subtract } 1 \text { from each side. } \\
\frac{-x}{-1} & =\frac{-6.5}{-1} & & \text { Simplify. } \\
x & =6.5 & & \text { Divide each side by }-1 . \\
& \text { Simplify. }
\end{array}
$$

The solution is $x=6.5$, which is the same solution obtained in Method 1 .

Use the table to find the number of miles $x$ you need to bike on Friday so that the mean number of miles biked per day is 5 .

## SOLUTION

| Day | Miles |
| :---: | :---: |
| Monday | 3.5 |
| Tuesday | 5.5 |
| Wednesday | 0 |
| Thursday | 5 |
| Friday | $x$ |

1. Understand the Problem You know how many miles you biked Monday through Thursday. You are asked to find the number of miles you need to bike on Friday so that the mean number of miles biked per day is 5 .
2. Make a Plan Use the definition of mean to write an equation that represents the problem. Then solve the equation.
3. Solve the Problem The mean of a data set is the sum of the data divided by the number of data values.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{3.5+5.5+0+5+x}{5} & =5 & & \text { Write the equation. } \\
\frac{14+x}{5} & =5 & & \text { Combine like terms. } \\
5 \cdot \frac{14+x}{5} & =5 \cdot 5 & & \text { Multiply each side by } 5 . \\
14+x & =25 & & \text { Simplify. } \\
\frac{-14}{x} & =14 & & \text { Subtract } 14 \text { from each side. } \\
x & =11 & & \text { Simplify. }
\end{aligned}
$$

- You need to bike 11 miles on Friday.

4. Look Back Notice that on the days that you did bike, the values are close to the mean. Because you did not bike on Wednesday, you need to bike about twice the mean on Friday. Eleven miles is about twice the mean. So, your solution is reasonable.

## REMEMBER

When you add miles to miles, you get miles. But, when you divide miles by days, you get miles per day.

## REMEMBER

When you multiply dollars per person by people, you get dollars.

## Using Unit Analysis to Model Real-Life Problems

When you write an equation to model a real-life problem, you should check that the units on each side of the equation balance. For instance, in Example 4, notice how the units balance.

## EXAMPLE 5 Solving a Real-Life Problem

Your school's drama club charges $\$ 4$ per person for admission to a play. The club borrowed $\$ 400$ to pay for costumes and props. After paying back the loan, the club has a profit of $\$ 100$. How many people attended the play?

## SOLUTION

1. Understand the Problem You know how much the club charges for admission. You also know how much the club borrowed and its profit. You are asked to find how many people attended the play.
2. Make a Plan Use a verbal model to write an equation that represents the problem. Then solve the equation.

## 3. Solve the Problem

Words $\quad$| Ticket |
| :--- |
| price |$\quad$\begin{tabular}{l}

Number of people <br>
who attended
\end{tabular}$-$\begin{tabular}{l}

Amount <br>

$$
\begin{aligned}
4 x-400 & =100 & & \text { Write the equation. } \\
4 x-400+400 & =100+400 & & \text { Add } 400 \text { to each side. } \\
4 x & =500 & & \text { Simplify. } \\
\frac{4 x}{4} & =\frac{500}{4} & & \text { Divide each side by } 4 . \\
x & =125 & & \text { Simplify. }
\end{aligned}
$$

- So, 125 people attended the play.

4. Look Back To check that your solution is reasonable, multiply $\$ 4$ per person by 125 people. The result is $\$ 500$. After paying back the $\$ 400$ loan, the club has $\$ 100$, which is the profit.

## Solving Equations with Variables on Both Sides

## Core Concept

## Solving Equations with Variables on Both Sides

To solve an equation with variables on both sides, simplify one or both sides of the equation, if necessary. Then use inverse operations to collect the variable terms on one side, collect the constant terms on the other side, and isolate the variable.

Check

$$
\begin{aligned}
10-4 x & =-9 x \\
10-4(-2) & \stackrel{?}{=}-9(-2) \\
18 & =18
\end{aligned}
$$

## EXAMPLE 1 Solving an Equation with Variables on Both Sides

Solve $10-4 x=-9 x$. Check your solution.

## SOLUTION

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
10-4 x=-9 x & & \text { Write the equation. } \\
\frac{+4 x}{10}=\frac{+4 x}{-5 x} & & \text { Add } 4 x \text { to each side. } \\
\frac{10}{-5}=\frac{-5 x}{-5} & & \text { Simplify. } \\
-2=x & & \text { Divide each side by }-5 \\
\text {-5implify. }
\end{array}
$$

The solution is $x=-2$.

## EXAMPLE 2 Solving an Equation with Grouping Symbols

Solve $3(3 x-4)=\frac{1}{4}(32 x+56)$.

## SOLUTION

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
3(3 x-4)= & \frac{1}{4}(32 x+56) & & \text { Write the equation. } \\
9 x-12=8 x+14 & & \text { Distributive Property } \\
\underline{+12} & \underline{+12} & & \text { Add } 12 \text { to each side. } \\
9 x=8 x+26 & & \text { Simplify. } \\
\underline{-8 x} & \underline{-8 x} & & \text { Subtract } 8 x \text { from each side. } \\
x=26 & & \text { Simplify. }
\end{array}
$$

The solution is $x=26$.

## Identifying Special Solutions of Linear Equations

## Core Concept

## Special Solutions of Linear Equations

Equations do not always have one solution. An equation that is true for all values of the variable is an identity and has infinitely many solutions. An equation that is not true for any value of the variable has no solution.

## EXAMPLE 3 Identifying the Number of Solutions

## REASONING

The equation $15 x+6=15 x$ is not true because the number $15 x$ cannot be equal to 6 more than itself.

## READING

All real numbers are solutions of an identity.

## STUDY TIP

To check an identity, you can choose several different values of the variable.

Solve each equation.
a. $3(5 x+2)=15 x$
b. $-2(4 y+1)=-8 y-2$

## SOLUTION

a.

| $3(5 x+2)$ | $=15 x$ |  | Write the equation. |
| ---: | :--- | ---: | :--- |
| $15 x+6$ | $=15 x$ |  | Distributive Property |
| $\underline{-15 x}$ | $\underline{-15 x}$ |  | Subtract $15 x$ from each side. |
| 6 | $=0$ |  | Simplify. |

- The statement $6=0$ is never true. So, the equation has no solution.
b.

| $-2(4 y+1)$ | $=-8 y-2$ |  | Write the equation. |
| ---: | :--- | ---: | :--- |
| $-8 y-2$ | $=-8 y-2$ |  | Distributive Property |
| $+8 y$ | $\underline{+8 y}$ |  | Add 8y to each side. |
| -2 | $=-2$ |  | Simplify. |

- The statement $-2=-2$ is always true. So, the equation is an identity and has infinitely many solutions.

Step 3 Collect the variable terms on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side.

Step 4 Isolate the variable.
Step 5 Check your solution.

## Solving Real-Life Problems

## EXAMPLE 4 Modeling with Mathematics

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/b1c41e13-cafa-46c5-832c-01ea0043bde5-23.jpg?height=547&width=478&top_left_y=356&top_left_x=139)

A boat leaves New Orleans and travels upstream on the Mississippi River for 4 hours. The return trip takes only 2.8 hours because the boat travels 3 miles per hour faster downstream due to the current. How far does the boat travel upstream?

## SOLUTION

1. Understand the Problem You are given the amounts of time the boat travels and the difference in speeds for each direction. You are asked to find the distance the boat travels upstream.
2. Make a Plan Use the Distance Formula to write expressions that represent the problem. Because the distance the boat travels in both directions is the same, you can use the expressions to write an equation.
3. Solve the Problem Use the formula (distance) = (rate)(time).

Words
Distance upstream = Distance downstream

Variable Let $x$ be the speed (in miles per hour) of the boat traveling upstream.
Equation $\frac{x \mathrm{mi}}{1, \mathrm{~K}} \cdot 4, \mathrm{~K}=\frac{(x+3) \mathrm{mi}}{1, \mathrm{~K}} \cdot 2.8, \mathrm{~K} \quad(\mathrm{mi}=\mathrm{mi})$

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
4 x & =2.8(x+3) & & \text { Write the equation. } \\
4 x & =2.8 x+8.4 & & \text { Distributive Property } \\
\frac{-2.8 x}{1.2 x} & =-2.8 x & & \text { Subtract } 2.8 x \text { from each side. } \\
\frac{1.2 x}{1.2} & =\frac{8.4}{1.2} & & \text { Simplify. } \\
x & =7 & & \text { Divide each side by 1.2. } \\
& & \text { Simplify. }
\end{array}
$$

- So, the boat travels 7 miles per hour upstream. To determine how far the boat travels upstream, multiply 7 miles per hour by 4 hours to obtain 28 miles.

4. Look Back To check that your solution is reasonable, use the formula for distance. Because the speed upstream is 7 miles per hour, the speed downstream is $7+3=10$ miles per hour. When you substitute each speed into the Distance Formula, you get the same distance for upstream and downstream.

## Upstream

Distance $=\frac{7 \mathrm{mi}}{1 \mathrm{~K}} \cdot 4 \not{K}=28 \mathrm{mi}$
Downstream
Distance $=\frac{10 \mathrm{mi}}{1 \mathrm{~K}} \cdot 2.8 \mathrm{~K}=28 \mathrm{mi}$

### 1.4 Lesson

## Core Vocabulary

absolute value equation, p. 28 extraneous solution, p. 31

## Previous

absolute value opposite

## What You Will Learn

Solve absolute value equations.
Solve equations involving two absolute values.
Identify special solutions of absolute value equations.

## Solving Absolute Value Equations

An absolute value equation is an equation that contains an absolute value expression. You can solve these types of equations by solving two related linear equations.

## Core Concept

## Properties of Absolute Value

Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers. Then the following properties are true.

1. $|a| \geq 0$
2. $|-a|=|a|$
3. $|a b|=|a||b|$
4. $\left|\frac{a}{b}\right|=\frac{|a|}{|b|}, b \neq 0$

## Solving Absolute Value Equations

To solve $|a x+b|=c$ when $c \geq 0$, solve the related linear equations

$$
a x+b=c \quad \text { or } \quad a x+b=-c .
$$

When $c<0$, the absolute value equation $|a x+b|=c$ has no solution because absolute value always indicates a number that is not negative.

## EXAMPLE 1 Solving Absolute Value Equations

Solve each equation. Graph the solutions, if possible.
a. $|x-4|=6$
b. $|3 x+1|=-5$

## SOLUTION

a. Write the two related linear equations for $|x-4|=6$. Then solve.

$$
\begin{array}{rlrlrl}
x-4 & =6 & \text { or } & & x-4 & =-6 \\
x & =10 & & & \text { Write related linear equations. }
\end{array}
$$

- The solutions are $x=10$ and $x=-2$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/b1c41e13-cafa-46c5-832c-01ea0043bde5-29.jpg?height=200&width=869&top_left_y=1942&top_left_x=837)
b. The absolute value of an expression must be greater than or equal to 0 . The expression $|3 x+1|$ cannot equal -5 .
- So, the equation has no solution.


## Monitoring Progress

Solve the equation. Graph the solutions, if possible.

1. $|x|=10$
2. $|x-1|=4$
3. $|3+x|=-3$

## EXAMPLE 2 Solving an Absolute Value Equation

Solve $|3 x+9|-10=-4$.

## SOLUTION

## ANOTHER WAY

Using the product property of absolute value, $|a b|=|a||b|$, you could rewrite the equation as

$$
3|x+3|-10=-4
$$

and then solve.

## REASONING

Mathematically proficient students have the ability to decontextualize problem situations.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/b1c41e13-cafa-46c5-832c-01ea0043bde5-30.jpg?height=762&width=516&top_left_y=1516&top_left_x=247)

First isolate the absolute value expression on one side of the equation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
|3 x+9|-10 & =-4 & & \text { Write the equation. } \\
|3 x+9| & =6 & & \text { Add } 10 \text { to each side. }
\end{aligned}
$$

Minimum
$|4-4.5|=0.5$

Now write two related linear equations for $|3 x+9|=6$. Then solve.

$$
\begin{array}{rlrlrl}
3 x+9 & =6 & \text { or } & 3 x+9 & =-6 & \\
3 x & =-3 & & \text { Write related linear equations. } \\
x & =-1 & 3 x & =-15 & & \text { Subtract } 9 \text { from each side. } \\
& & x & =-5 & & \text { Divide each side by } 3 .
\end{array}
$$

Maximum
$|5-4.5|=0.5$

The solutions are $x=-1$ and $x=-5$.

## EXAMPLE 3 Writing an Absolute Value Equation

In a cheerleading competition, the minimum length of a routine is 4 minutes. The maximum length of a routine is 5 minutes. Write an absolute value equation that represents the minimum and maximum lengths.

## SOLUTION

1. Understand the Problem You know the minimum and maximum lengths. You are asked to write an absolute value equation that represents these lengths.

## Solving Equations with Two Absolute Values

If the absolute values of two algebraic expressions are equal, then they must either be equal to each other or be opposites of each other.

## Core Concept

## Solving Equations with Two Absolute Values

To solve $|a x+b|=|c x+d|$, solve the related linear equations

$$
a x+b=c x+d \quad \text { or } \quad a x+b=-(c x+d) .
$$

## EXAMPLE 4 Solving Equations with Two Absolute Values

Solve (a) $|3 x-4|=|x|$ and (b) $|4 x-10|=2|3 x+1|$.

## SOLUTION

Check

$$
\begin{aligned}
|3 x-4| & =|x| \\
|3(2)-4| & \stackrel{?}{=}|2| \\
|2| & \stackrel{?}{=}|2| \\
2 & =2 \\
|3 x-4| & =|x| \\
|3(1)-4| & \stackrel{?}{=}|1| \\
|-1| & \stackrel{?}{=}|1| \\
1 & =1
\end{aligned}
$$

a. Write the two related linear equations for $|3 x-4|=|x|$. Then solve.

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
3 x-4 & =x & \text { or } & 3 x-4 \\
\frac{-x}{2 x-4} & =-x \\
\frac{-x}{4} & \frac{+x}{4 x}-4 & =0 \\
2 x & =4 & \frac{+x}{4 x} & =\frac{+4}{4} \\
\frac{2 x}{2} & =\frac{4}{2} & \frac{4 x}{4} & =\frac{4}{4} \\
x & =2 & x & =1
\end{array}
$$

The solutions are $x=2$ and $x=1$.
b. Write the two related linear equations for $|4 x-10|=2|3 x+1|$. Then solve.

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
4 x-10 & =2(3 x+1) & \text { or } & 4 x-10 \\
4 x-10 & =6 x+2 & 4 x-10 & =2(-3 x-1) \\
\frac{-6 x}{-2 x-10} & =\frac{-6 x}{2} & 4 x-10 & =-6 x-2 \\
\frac{+10}{-2 x} & =\frac{+10}{12} & \frac{+6 x}{10 x}-10 & =-2 \\
\frac{-2 x}{-2} & =\frac{12}{-2} & \underline{+10} & =+10 \\
x & =-6 & 10 x & =8 \\
\frac{10 x}{10} & =\frac{8}{10} \\
x & =0.8
\end{array}
$$

Solve the equation. Check your solutions.
8. $|x+8|=|2 x+1|$
9. $3|x-4|=|2 x+5|$

## Identifying Special Solutions

When you solve an absolute value equation, it is possible for a solution to be extraneous. An extraneous solution is an apparent solution that must be rejected because it does not satisfy the original equation.

## EXAMPLE 5 Identifying Extraneous Solutions

Solve $|2 x+12|=4 x$. Check your solutions.

## SOLUTION

## Check

$$
\begin{aligned}
|2 x+12| & =4 x \\
|2(6)+12| & \stackrel{?}{=} 4(6) \\
|24| & \stackrel{?}{=} 24 \\
24 & =24 \\
|2 x+12| & =4 x \\
|2(-2)+12| & \stackrel{?}{=} 4(-2) \\
|8| & \stackrel{?}{=}-8 \\
8 & \neq-8
\end{aligned}
$$

## REMEMBER

Always check your solutions in the original equation to make sure they are not extraneous.

Write the two related linear equations for $|2 x+12|=4 x$. Then solve.

$$
\begin{array}{rlrlrl}
2 x+12 & =4 x & \text { or } & 2 x+12 & =-4 x & \\
12 & =2 x & & \text { Write related linear equations. } \\
6 & =x & & 12 & =-6 x & \\
\text { Subtract } 2 x \text { from each side. }
\end{array}
$$

Check the apparent solutions to see if either is extraneous.
The solution is $x=6$. Reject $x=-2$ because it is extraneous.
When solving equations of the form $|a x+b|=|c x+d|$, it is possible that one of the related linear equations will not have a solution.

## EXAMPLE 6 Solving an Equation with Two Absolute Values

Solve $|x+5|=|x+11|$.

## SOLUTION

By equating the expression $x+5$ and the opposite of $x+11$, you obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
x+5 & =-(x+11) & & \text { Write related linear equation. } \\
x+5 & =-x-11 & & \text { Distributive Property } \\
2 x+5 & =-11 & & \text { Add } x \text { to each side. } \\
2 x & =-16 & & \text { Subtract } 5 \text { from each side. } \\
x & =-8 . & & \text { Divide each side by } 2 .
\end{aligned}
$$

However, by equating the expressions $x+5$ and $x+11$, you obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
x+5 & =x+11 & & \text { Write related linear equation. } \\
x & =x+6 & & \text { Subtract } 5 \text { from each side. } \\
0 & =6 \quad \mathbf{X} & & \text { Subtract } x \text { from each side. }
\end{aligned}
$$

which is a false statement. So, the original equation has only one solution.
The solution is $x=-8$.

- Rewrite and use other common formulas.


## Rewriting Literal Equations

An equation that has two or more variables is called a literal equation. To rewrite a literal equation, solve for one variable in terms of the other variable(s).

## EXAMPLE 1 Rewriting a Literal Equation

Solve the literal equation $3 y+4 x=9$ for $y$.

## SOLUTION

$$
\begin{aligned}
3 y+4 x & =9 & & \text { Write the equation. } \\
3 y+4 x-4 x & =9-4 x & & \text { Subtract } 4 x \text { from each side. } \\
3 y & =9-4 x & & \text { Simplify. } \\
\frac{3 y}{3} & =\frac{9-4 x}{3} & & \text { Divide each side by } 3 . \\
y & =3-\frac{4}{3} x & & \text { Simplify. }
\end{aligned}
$$

- The rewritten literal equation is $y=3-\frac{4}{3} x$.


## EXAMPLE 2 Rewriting a Literal Equation

Solve the literal equation $y=3 x+5 x z$ for $x$.

## SOLUTION

$$
\begin{aligned}
y & =3 x+5 x z & & \text { Write the equation. } \\
y & =x(3+5 z) & & \text { Distributive Property } \\
\frac{y}{3+5 z} & =\frac{x(3+5 z)}{3+5 z} & & \text { Divide each side by } 3+5 z . \\
\frac{y}{3+5 z} & =x & & \text { Simplify. }
\end{aligned}
$$

The rewritten literal equation is $x=\frac{y}{3+5 z}$.
In Example 2, you must assume that $z \neq-\frac{3}{5}$ in order to divide by $3+5 z$. In general, if you have to divide by a variable or variable expression when solving a literal equation, you should assume that the variable or variable expression does not equal 0 .

## Rewriting and Using Formulas for Area

A formula shows how one variable is related to one or more other variables. A formula is a type of literal equation.

## EXAMPLE 3 Rewriting a Formula for Surface Area

The formula for the surface area $S$ of a rectangular prism is $S=2 \ell w+2 \ell h+2 w h$. Solve the formula for the length $\ell$.

## SOLUTION

$$
\begin{aligned}
S & =2 \ell w+2 \ell h+2 w h & & \text { Write the equation. } \\
S-2 w h & =2 \ell w+2 \ell h+2 w h-2 w h & & \text { Subtract } 2 w h \text { from each side. } \\
S-2 w h & =2 \ell w+2 \ell h & & \text { Simplify. } \\
S-2 w h & =\ell(2 w+2 h) & & \text { Distributive Property } \\
\frac{S-2 w h}{2 w+2 h} & =\frac{\ell(2 w+2 h)}{2 w+2 h} & & \text { Divide each side by } 2 w+2 h . \\
\frac{S-2 w h}{2 w+2 h} & =\ell & & \text { Simplify. }
\end{aligned}
$$

- When you solve the formula for $\ell$, you obtain $\ell=\frac{S-2 w h}{2 w+2 h}$.


## EXAMPLE 4 Using a Formula for Area

You own a rectangular lot that is 500 feet deep. It has an area of 100,000 square feet. To pay for a new water system, you are assessed $\$ 5.50$ per foot of lot frontage.
a. Find the frontage of your lot.
b. How much are you assessed for the new water system?

## SOLUTION

a. In the formula for the area of a rectangle, let the width $w$ represent the lot frontage.

$$
\begin{aligned}
A & =\ell w & & \text { Write the formula for area of a rectangle. } \\
\frac{A}{\ell} & =w & & \text { Divide each side by } \ell \text { to solve for } w . \\
\frac{100,000}{500} & =w & & \text { Substitute } 100,000 \text { for } A \text { and } 500 \text { for } \ell . \\
200 & =w & & \text { Simplify. }
\end{aligned}
$$

- The frontage of your lot is 200 feet.
b. Each foot of frontage costs $\$ 5.50$, and $\frac{\$ 5.50}{1 \mathrm{ft}} \cdot 200 \mathrm{ft}=\$ 1100$.
- So, your total assessment is $\$ 1100$.

## EXAMPLE 6 Using the Formula for Temperature

Which has the greater surface temperature: Mercury or Venus?

## SOLUTION

Convert the Celsius temperature of Mercury to degrees Fahrenheit.
$F=\frac{9}{5} C+32$
Write the rewritten formula from Example 5.
$=\frac{9}{5}(427)+32$
Substitute 427 for $C$.
$=800.6$
Simplify.

Because $864^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ is greater than $800.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, Venus has the greater surface temperature.

## EXAMPLE 7 Using the Formula for Simple Interest

## COMMON ERROR

The unit of $t$ is years. Be sure to convert months to years.

$$
\frac{1 \mathrm{yr}}{12 \mathrm{~m} \sigma} \cdot 6 \mathrm{~m} \sigma=0.5 \mathrm{yr}
$$

You deposit $\$ 5000$ in an account that earns simple interest. After 6 months, the account earns $\$ 162.50$ in interest. What is the annual interest rate?

## SOLUTION

To find the annual interest rate, solve the simple interest formula for $r$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
I & =P r t & & \text { Write the simple interest formula. } \\
\frac{I}{P t} & =r & & \text { Divide each side by Pt to solve for } r . \\
\frac{162.50}{(5000)(0.5)} & =r & & \text { Substitute } 162.50 \text { for } I, 5000 \text { for } P, \text { and } 0.5 \text { for } t . \\
0.065 & =r & & \text { Simplify. }
\end{aligned}
$$

The annual interest rate is 0.065 , or $6.5 \%$.

## EXAMPLE 8 Solving a Real-Life Problem

A truck driver averages 60 miles per hour while delivering freight to a customer. On the return trip, the driver averages 50 miles per hour due to construction. The total driving time is 6.6 hours. How long does each trip take?

## SOLUTION

Step 1 Rewrite the Distance Formula to write expressions that represent the two trip times. Solving the formula $d=r t$ for $t$, you obtain $t=\frac{d}{r}$. So, $\frac{d}{60}$ represents the delivery time, and $\frac{d}{50}$ represents the return trip time.

Step 2 Use these expressions and the total driving time to write and solve an equation to find the distance one way.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{60}+\frac{d}{50} & =6.6 & & \text { The sum of the two trip times is } 6.6 \text { hours. } \\
\frac{11 d}{300} & =6.6 & & \text { Add the left side using the LCD. } \\
11 d & =1980 & & \text { Multiply each side by } 300 \text { and simplify. } \\
d & =180 & & \text { Divide each side by } 11 \text { and simplify. }
\end{aligned}
$$

The distance one way is 180 miles.
Step 3 Use the expressions from Step 1 to find the two trip times.

- So, the delivery takes $180 \mathrm{mi} \div \frac{60 \mathrm{mi}}{1 \mathrm{~h}}=3$ hours, and the return trip takes $180 \mathrm{mi} \div \frac{50 \mathrm{mi}}{1 \mathrm{~h}}=3.6$ hours.
